# Amiga Learning Rules

- Treat PDFs, images, and archives as read-only sources.
- Primarily use "Bare-metal Amiga programming 2021_ocr.pdf" and
  "Classic AmigaOS programming 2019_ocr.pdf" for learning, but also use
  other available Amiga references as supporting sources.
- Add new learning notes as Markdown with clear, descriptive filenames.
- Include source references (file paths or URLs) and page numbers when relevant.
- Keep terminology consistent with the original Amiga/Alicia docs.
- Prefer detailed summaries (still avoid large verbatim excerpts).
- Avoid hallucinations; if unsure, say "I don't know" or "I don't have that knowledge" and ask to verify.
