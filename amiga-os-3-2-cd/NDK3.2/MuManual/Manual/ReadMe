This directory contains the "Programmer's Manual" for the MMU Library,
a description and tutorial of the MuLib functions in "RKRM" style.

For compatibility reasons and to provide optimal qualitiy, I decided
to write this manual in LaTeX. Unlike previous releases, both a "dvi"
output and a "PDF" output are included.

The ".dvi" file can be printed by the "DVIPrint" program which is,
for example, part of the PasTex package. It is also available on the
Aminet. The file can be browsed on the screen with "ShowDVI", a 
"dvi previewer". On many Un*x installations, the "xdvi" program will 
provide the same. 

The ".pdf" file can be displayed by the "APDF" viewer you find in 
the Aminet, or any PC running Linux or Windows.

Redistribution of this manual is allowed according to my "licence rules",
as usual. This means, for short, that the manual is free for private users.
In case you want to publish this manual, for example on a CR-ROM, and want
to redistribute it, please contact me.  The full licence is in the manual,
please consult it for further details.


So long,
