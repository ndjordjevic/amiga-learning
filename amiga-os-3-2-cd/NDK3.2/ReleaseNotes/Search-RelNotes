-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

Changes for release 45.1 (18.11.2017)

- Search did not use the locale to translate
  characters to upper case, hence could have
  failed to find results with funny european
  characters correctly.

- Recompiled with SAS/C.

Changes for release 45.2 (19.1.2018)

- Increased the file size buffers.

- Added the CASE command line switch for
  case-sensitive searching. Note that this
  switch is INACTIVE when searching for files.

Changes for release 45.3 (23.1.2018)

- Case-insensitive matching is now applied through
  ParsePatternNoCase(), not by preprocessing.
  Unfortunately, dos internally does not use proper
  case-insensitive matching either, but just
  attempts to convert characters to upper case and
  compare then. This may, however, fail, for example
  the German sharp-s does not have an upper case
  equivalent (at least not in ISO latin 1).

Changes for release 45.4 (7.2.2018)

- Searches for file contents without CASE and PATTERN
  options did not convert the search argument to upper
  case and hence did not return any results if it was
  not already upper case.

- If searching for non-FILE, then the maximum search
  length is now increased to 1024 characters. For files,
  it remains at 255 due to BCPL limitations.

Changes for release 45.5 (10.2.2018)

- For some strange reason, Search checked "c+1" against
  being an ANSI control character instead of "c" directly,
  resulting in identifying 0xff as control char, which it
  is not in the ISO-Latin character set.

- Error messages are now printed over pr_CES.

Changes for release 47.1 (28.11.2019)

- Bumped to v47.
