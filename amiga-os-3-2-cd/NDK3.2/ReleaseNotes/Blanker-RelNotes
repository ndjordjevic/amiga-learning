-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

Changes for release 45.1 (26.5.2018):

- Updated to the new locale inclusion mechanism.

- Uses now a minimalistic startup code.

- Recompiled with SAS/C.

---------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project ---------------------------

Changes for release 47.1 (15.6.2019):

- Made the GUI scalable.

Changes for release 47.2 (20.6.2019):

- In case the default font changed while the commodity
  was hidden, the window re-opens now with the new font.

Changes for release 47.3 (19.5.2020):

- Added Help-key / Help menu with AmigaGuide support.

Changes for release 47.4 (4.6.2020):

- Moved the CloseAmigaGuide stuff out of DisposeWindow() to avoid
  blowing up AmigaGuide when hiding the application window.

- Replaced accesses to SysBase->ThisTask with FindTask(NULL)

- Changed GNUMakefile version to 47 to keep make version happy

- Changed build order of ce_main and ce_custom to fix a dependency 
  issue.

Changes for release 47.5 (11.6.2020):

- The signal mask was set up outside the main loop hence it would
  ignore signals from the IDCMP port if the Commodity was started
  with CX_POPUP=NO and the window openend later. (Fixes bug #1595)

Changes for release 47.6 (31.8.2020):

- AmigaGuide stuff is now initialized/disposed when the window is 
  being created or closed (moved code to CreateWindow() / back to 
  DisposeWindow())
