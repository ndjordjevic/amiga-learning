-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

Changes for release 45.1 (20.5.2018)

- Added a toolbar betweeen Paste and Erase.

- IconEdit did not use its program name to load
  and save its preferences into its icon, but the
  hard-coded name "IconEdit".

- Shortened the startup code and adjusted to the new
  locale inclusion method.

Changes for release 45.2 (11.8.2018)

- The editor did not determine the screen depth in an
  RTG robust way, and - due to the way how it interacts
  with datatypes - might have ended up in a situation
  where it received a non-native bitplane from the datatype
  it cannot handle. Due to that, clipboard operations
  where likely broken.

- The editor provided an invalid number of sparse pens for
  datatype color remapping.

- Removed pointless stub functions.
