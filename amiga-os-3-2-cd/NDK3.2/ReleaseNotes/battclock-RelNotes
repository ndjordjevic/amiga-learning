-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

Changes for release 45.1 (30.11.2017)

- Added dummy read instructions from the chipset to
  slow the CPU down on fast machines to avoid trouble
  in case the clock cannot keep up with the CPU.
  
- Replaced clr instructions on clock registers by moves
  with zero as the former performs a dummy read on some
  CPUs that may confuse the clock, potentially.

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

Changes for release 47.1 (8.8.2019):

- Bumped for consistency and to avoid trouble with
  LoadModule attempting to update the resource.

Changes for release 47.2 (16.9.2020):

- Fixed an issue where WriteBattClockMem would trash the 
  return address on the stack if the caller tries to write 
  beyond the clock chip memory limit.
- Updated GNUMakefile version to 47
