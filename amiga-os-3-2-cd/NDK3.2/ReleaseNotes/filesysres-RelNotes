----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

New in release 47.1 (8.8.2019):

- Bumped to 47.1 for consistency.

New in release 47.2 (25.8.2019):

- The filesys resource now checks the actual file system present
  in the resident list of the ROM for the version that is available
  instead of assuming that the same version as its own version is
  always available.

New in release 47.3 (23.11.2019):

- The filesystem did not include the revision in the parsing of
  the filesystem release version and hence might have derived
  an incorrect version of the resident file system.

New in release 47.4 (16.01.2021):

- The resident file system version was not correctly parsed for
  the update of the DOSTYPE array. DOS\6 and DOS\7 were left out
  of the default array for certain revisions of the FFS.
