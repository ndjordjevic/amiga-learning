  if ToolType "ENABLEPREVIEW" is set or if shell argument

Changes for Reaction 47.3 (1.11.2019):

- Implemented preview feature.

- Fixed: GadTools version had broken handling of label
  alignment and label colour fields.

- Fixed default backdrop pattern path 

- Backdrop pattern path is now inserted properly into file
  requester.

Changes for Reaction 47.6 (1.11.2019):

- Font name strings now no longer contain font size. Why on
  earth is Reaction reading the fonts' names from a string
  instead of the TextAttr structure?

- The maximum value for layout spacing has been reduced to 
  8px, as with the OS3.9 version.

- Added a listbrowser gadget, with fallback font display,
  to the preview window.

Changes for Reaction 47.8 (22.12.2019):

- The font TextAttr handling was upside down and could
  access or overwrite random memory locations.

Changes for Reaction 47.9 (1.1.2020):

- The default font size was not set to 8, but left at 0.

- Changing the label font did not trigger a refresh.

Changes for Reaction 47.10 (5.1.2020):

- Cleaned up the gui layout

  is closed and restores it when it gets reopenend.

- Added support for the new V47+ help system. The common PrefsEd 
  code will now scan HELP:<mylocale>/sys/Prefs/<PrefsEdName>.guide 
  for an AmigaGuide document which offers a documentation of the 
  respective Preference editor. 
  If unsuccessful, it'll search for a fallback in HELP:english/sys/.

  SNPrintf()/Strncpy() et al.
