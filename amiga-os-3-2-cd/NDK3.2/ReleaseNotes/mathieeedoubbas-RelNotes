-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

Changes for V45.6 (30.12.2016)

- Added a magic libbase replacement that automatically switches the
  library base if the math hardware changes, for example through 
  setpatch. No need for setpatch to play with the library base 
  anymore.

- Re-did the integration into the V45 build from the V50.1 version in
  a better way. No longer depends on the hx68 assembler, now uses
  clear-text FPU primitives.

- Now builds with SAS/C and its assembler.

Changes for V45.7 (2.1.2017)

- Apparently, the magic library replacement could have resulted in
  situations where the dead library base is removed while some 
  programs are still using it, and hence causing a crash. This happens 
  only if a program re-opens the math.library, but does not update its 
  internal pointers, and then closes the library through the old, 
  non-updated pointer, finally pulling the rug under its feed. Arexx 
  seem to be notorious about this, but other programs may exist that 
  assume that the library base stays constant. Thus, to avoid any 
  further trouble, the obsolete library stays resident in memory 
  forever, causing a slight loss of memory.

Changes for V45.8 (6.5.2018)

- Due to a misconfigured assembler, some harmless code was only 
  runable on a 68020 or beyond. Fixed that.

Changes for V45.9 (16.7.2018)

- The rounding mode for mathieeedoubbas was changed to round to zero,
  full precision. This is to make the code consistent with the CPU
  code, and to allow parallel usage of the singbas and doubbas
  library.

---------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project ---------------------------

Changes for V47.1 (20.6.2019):

- All CPU implementations have been reworked to make use of sticky 
  bits and to implement an IEEE-aware "round to even". Also, the FPU 
  precision was changed to "round to even, double precision", which 
  gives an "Excellent result" on the paranoia test.


Changes 47.2 (27.4.2020)

- Added fix for the IEEEDPAdd() function, which failed to add the
  carry. Thanks go to Thomas Richter for finding the bug and providing
  the remedy :-)
