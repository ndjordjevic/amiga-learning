------------------------------ AmigaOS 3.2 project -------------------

Changes for release 45.1 (12.4.2019)

- Recompiled with SAS/C, no functional changes.

- The program might have crashed in case there was
  no memory for a struct FileInfoBlock. The structure
  is now taken from the stack.
- A bit of cleanup.

Changes for release 45.2 (30.12.2019)

- Which checked (for some reason?) the script and
  executable bit of the root directory if the argument
  passed in ends with a colon. It now just prints the
  volume name in such a case.
