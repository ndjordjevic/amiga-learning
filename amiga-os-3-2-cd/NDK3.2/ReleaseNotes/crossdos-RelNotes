----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

Changes for release 47.1 (15.06.2019):

- In case the default font changed while the commodity
  was hidden, the window re-opens now with the new font.

Changes for release 47.3 (21.05.2020):

- Added Help-key / Help menu with AmigaGuide support 

Changes for release 47.4 (04.06.2020):

- Moved the CloseAmigaGuide stuff out of DisposeWindow() to avoid
  blowing up AmigaGuide when hiding the application window.

- Replaced accesses to SysBase->ThisTask with FindTask(NULL)

Changes for release 47.5 (11.06.2020):

- The signal mask was set up outside the main loop hence it would
  ignore signals from the IDCMP port if the Commodity was started
  with CX_POPUP=NO and the window openend later. (Fixes bug #1595)

Changes for release 47.6:

- AmigaGuide stuff is now initialized/disposed when the window is 
  being created or closed (moved code to CreateWindow() / back to 
  DisposeWindow())
