------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4(.1) project ------------------------

Changes for release 45.1 (14.8.2018):

- Fixed a race condition on library lifetime handling.

- Fixed a potential memory leak on library init.

Changes for release 45.2 (10.9.2018):

- Fixed another race condition on LibOpen.

Changes for release 45.3 (17.8.2019):

- The code overwrite image data beyond the right
  border and forgot to clean the bitmap before use.

- The code forgot to release a temporary buffer, thus
  leaked memory.

- Error codes were not properly set.

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

Changes for release 47.1 (25.8.2019):

- This is almost a complete rewrite of the BMP datatype
  which supports now compression, bitfields, 16 to 32
  bit true color images and 1 to 8 bit palette images,
  with or without compression.

Changes for release 47.2 (1.9.2019):

- Sets now the buffer size of the input buffer to a complete
  sector (512 bytes) to avoid copying overhead at the file
  system.

Changes for release 47.3 (28.9.2019):

- The end-of-line token of compressed BMP also incremented the
  line at the beginning of the current line without a single
  valid pixel in the current line. This got fixed.
