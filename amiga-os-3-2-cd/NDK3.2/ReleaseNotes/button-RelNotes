------------------------ AmigaOS 4 project ---------------------------

button.gadget 50.1 (29.06.02)

- initial release for OS4.

button.gadget 50.2 (26.9.2002)

- now supports the new "realistic shading" features of Intuition for
  hicolor and truecolor screens.

button.gadget 50.3 (4.10.2002)

- fixed a bug which could make the gadget install an invalid backfill
  hook if its parent layout used a fill pattern.

button.gadget 50.4 (14.10.2002)

- no longer calls OpenDiskFont() if not running in the context of a
  process.

button.gadget 50.5 (7.11.2002)

- now buttons with arrow symbols use sysiclass instances when running
  under Intuition V50 (and using glyph.image 50.23+); this required
  a slight modification in the image layout code.

button.gadget 50.6 (29.03.2003)

- the gadget box is cached in GM_LAYOUT, now.

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

button.gadget 50.7 (18.8.2019)

- Notice that v50.7 reflects only a transitional status between the 
  OS4 and 3.2 projects.

- fixed race condition when opening/closing.

- now runs on 68000/68010.

button.gadget 47.1 (1.9.2019):

- recompiled with data=far and utllib to improve
  the code generation.

button.gadget 47.2 (6.3.2020):

- Added BAG_POPDATE and BAG_POPCOLOR.

button.gadget 47.3 (3.4.2020):

- Reduced horizontal padding to match vertical padding.

button.gadget 47.4 (16.7.2020):

- Fixed: BUTTON_AutoButtons selected via keyboard tabbing were
  not rendering their glyph.

button.gadget 47.5 (10.1.2021):

- Now uses a BVS_DISPLAY bevel frame when read-only, if bevel.image
  is version 47 or higher.
  
- Added support for the new BUTTON_TextPadding attribute, which can
  be used by applications to make the button a little wider when it
  contains text. Setting this to TRUE adds extra spacing around the
  button's label (currently twice the nominal width of the button's
  font). Defaults to FALSE for compatibility reasons.

button.gadget 47.6 (15.2.2021):

- Fix that interim updates were not marked as such

button.gadget 47.7 (1.3.2021):

- Fix that the buttonw tried to busy wait 1 second when activating by
  keyboard
- Much better rendering of active state of button, although it probably
  could be better still
