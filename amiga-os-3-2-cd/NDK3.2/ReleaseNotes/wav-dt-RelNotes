------------------------ AmigaOS 4 project ---------------------------

wav.datatype 51.1 (7.11.2004) 

- initial release.

wav.datatype 51.2 (13.11.2004)

- implemented saving.

wav.datatype 51.3 (3.4.2005)

- fixed decoding of stereo samples.

wav.datatype 51.4 (12.10.2005) 

- Now with OS3.x compatible version string.

- The 68k stubs are now in C.

- No longer allocates MEMF_PUBLIC memory.

- Build without support for mpega.library because the necessary 
  includes are missing in CVS.

- Now builds with gcc 4.0.0 with -Wall -Werror.

- All global data is now read-only.

- Removed empty sections.

wav.datatype 51.5 (14.10.2005)

- Added a new datatype descriptor with a matching version number
  and ensured its always automatically rebuild with the same version
  number as the datatype itself.

wav.datatype 51.6 (10.11.2005)

- fixed crash with malformed samples. And no new descriptor was 
  included because Amiga Rexx doesn't run on Linux x86... (beside that 
  a new descriptor with every new release is IMHO nonsense anyway).

- re-enabled mpeg audio support.

wav.datatype 52.1 (10.12.2006)

- Now builds with -Wwrite-strings.

wav.datatype 52.2 (08.03.2007)

- fixed mpeg decoder.

wav.datatype 52.3 (22.04.2007)

- now support 32bit PCM samples.

wav.datatype 52.4 (23.9.2007)

- FreeVec() could be called with incremented pointers, fixed.
  Thanks to Thore Böckelmann for the report.

wav.datatype 53.1 (19.6.2009) 

- Bumped to 53.

- Fixed obtain/release vectors.

- Fixed up makefile.os4.

- Refactored library initialization to remove the broken lock 
  Semaphore code which is common to almost all classes.

- Refactored code to use struct ClassLibrary as a base.

- Added some test files.

- Added mkrelease script.

- Converted to newlib from clib2.

- Compiled with GCC 4.2.4 and fixed all warnings.

- Bumped minimum version requirements to 53.

wav.datatype 53.2 (29.10.2009) 

- While basically prepared to handle >8bit WAV-PCM data, the support 
  was utterly incomplete, broken and never worked.
  Completed and fixed support for >8bit WAV-PCM both for loading and 
  saving. Needs sound.datatype 53.2.

wav.datatype 53.3 (31.10.2009) 

- Fixed DVI/IMA-ADPCM decoding to make use of the newly introduced 
  16bit capabilities. Thanks to Alex Carmona for the report. #5688

- Also fixed Microsoft ADPCM, A-Law and mu-Law decoding while I was at 
  it ;)

  Note: The wav datatype also supports MPEG encoded sound data, but as 
        I didn't find any program for Amiga or Windows which could 
        generate such wav files I didn't touch that code. If you have 
        such files, please let me know (and also if you have wav with 
        still unsupported sound data encoding). Thanks.

wav.datatype 53.4 (18.11.2009) 

- Fixed support for MPEG encoded sound data and made it behave exactly 
  like the mpega.library docs tell. Now it plays wave-encapsulated MP3 
  data nicely. Thanks to Thore Böckelmann for providing some testfiles 
  (Rest assured, I won't doom you for your music taste :-) ).

wav.datatype 53.5 (5.6.2010)

- Removed double buffering scheme which used DOS packets.

- Built with SDK 53.20 toolset.

------------------------ AmigaOS 3.2 project -------------------------

wav.datatype 47.1 (17.5.2020)

- Ported to OS3.2.

wav.datatype 47.2 (3.4.2021)

- Fixed a memory leak.
