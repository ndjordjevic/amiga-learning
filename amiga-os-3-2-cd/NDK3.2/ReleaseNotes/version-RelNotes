-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

Changes for version 45.1 (26.3.2018):

- Version now scans the seglist for mounted file systems,
  independent on whether they have a startup vector or not.

- There are a couple of hard-coded cases for which the dos
  library startup code does not leave sufficient information
  in the device node to find the version, namely RAW:, CON:
  and RAM:, which are now redirected the corresponding
  ROM-Module names.

- In case a handler version is requested, but the handler is
  not yet loaded, version now redirects to the handler file
  and checks for versions there. This enables versioning
  of PAR:, PRT: and SER:.

Changes for version 45.2 (8.4.2018):

- Fixed a hit if version is called without arguments.

Changes for version 45.3 (25.9.2018):

- The version numbers from workbench and icon are now
  taken from disk, if available.

Changes for version 45.4 (4.8.2019):

- If the argument to version is a path, version now
  automatically switches to file version information
  rather than module information.

Changes for version 45.5 (24.8.2019):

- The above modification ruled out the case where the
  argument is a device name itself, hence versions could
  not be obtained from the devices. This got fixed.

Changes for version 45.6 (4.9.2019):

- The scanner for the $VER token was considerably broken
  and could both ignore valid $VER tokens, and both loop
  endlessly if a $ sign was close to the end of the file.

Changes for version 47.1 (1.1.2020):

- Backported the optimized version scanner from workbench,
  reduced to utility.library functions for arithmetic.
  
- The version tool could leak memory or release memory twice,
  actually, memory management was bonkers.

Changes for version 47.2 (3.1.2020):

- Due to the presence of the version tag in the version scanning method,
  version could no longer find the version of itself. Bummer!

Changes for version 47.3 (31.1.2021):

- Fixed issue where looking for a version string on the DOS resident list
  would cause an infinite loop.
