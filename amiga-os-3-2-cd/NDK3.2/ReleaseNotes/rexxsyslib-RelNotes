-------------------- AmigaOS 3.5/3.9 project -------------------------

rexxsyslib 44.1 (25.12.1999)

- Modified WaitDOSPkt() to call WaitPort() instead of Wait()'ing
  on the MsgPort's signal. I hope that this is really an improvement.
  The documentation for the WaitDOSPkt() function states its
  purpose as "Waits at the specified message port for a message or
  other signal.". Might be that the side-effect was intentional :-/

- Fixed a long standing bug in the CPU type identification code.
  It no longer mistakenly identifies a machine with an 68040
  CPU as having an "68060" CPU installed. The new code also
  make a point of identifying an 68882 FPU and an 68060 CPU.

rexxsyslib 45.3 (19.8.2001)

- This release integrates the RVI (rexx variable interface)
  into the core library.
- Starting a rexx program now re-initializes the mathieeedoubbas
  library and hence the FPU.

-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

rexxsyslib 45.4 (25.5.2017)

- Ported back to h68x.
- the rx startup code closes now the same copy of the mathieeedoubbas
  library it opened, hence avoiding a potential conflict with the
  new V45 release of it.
  
rexxsyslib 45.5 (1.7.2017)

- Eliminated FindDevice() from the rexx startup code because it can
  neither handle multi assigns correctly, nor is it safe due to a lacking
  lock of the DOS device list.
- Due to the above fix, "rx" will now find rexx programs in a multi-assign.
- WORD() only takes 2 arguments and never three.

---------------------------- AmigaOs 3.2 project ---------------------

rexxsyslib 47.1 (5.8.2017)

- rexx no longer rolls CLIs itself but uses AllocDosOject() and
  FreeDosObject(), as it should. This creates objects of the proper size.
  
rexxsyslib 47.2 (19.8.2017)

- The date() computations were a bit off. First, the 'c' formatting was
  not using the latest century as base date, but was always using 1900
  as base, which is incorrect. Second, even then it was forgotten that
  1900 was not a leap year, so date computations were off by one day for
  'c' (note that this bug is still persistent in the Os4 version). Also,
  the number of days since Jan 1st, 1 AD was off, but then again, Rexx
  does not support the calendar switch from Julian to Gregorian. Also
  note that leap year calculations are currently off, though Arexx only
  accepts dates between 1978 and 2100 and in this period, everything is
  fine. (Note that a year to be divisible by 4 is not sufficient to be
  a leap year. Centuries are not leap years, unless they are divisible by
  400 as well).
