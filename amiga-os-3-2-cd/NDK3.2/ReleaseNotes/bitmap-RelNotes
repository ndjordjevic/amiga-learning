------------------------- AmigaOS 4 project --------------------------

bitmap.image 50.1 (17.02.2002)

- initial release for AmigaOS4.

- implemented IA_Scalable.

bitmap.image 50.2 (21.03.2003) 

- The temporary masking bitmap is now
  initialized with the width/height values
  from the source bitmap when doing
  transparent blits to interleaved
  screens. This fixes PartitionWizard
  displaying corrupted buttons with
  50.1.

------------------------ AmigaOS 3.2 project -------------------------

bitmap.image 50.3 (18.08.2019)

- Notice that v50.3 reflects only a transitional status between the 
  OS4 and 3.2 projects.
  
- fixed race condition when opening/closing.

- now runs on 68000/68010.

bitmap.image 47.1 (1.9.2019):

- recompiled with data=far and utllib to improve
  the code generation.

bitmap.image 47.2 (7.2.2021):

- No longer allows the library to be expunged if the class cannot be
  freed due to it having outstanding instances.
  
- Now always tries to open the needed libraries whenever the library
  is reopened while still in memory with lib_OpenCnt == 0, which was
  previously not being done if the class already existed. This would
  make the class crash as soon as the opening program used it, since
  all internal library pointers were still NULL.
  This situation could arise when an application closed bitmap.image
  at some point without disposing of all of its instances first (for
  example, at least some versions of AWeb are known to do that).
