----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

Changes for release 45.1 (6.4.2019):

- LayoutMenusA() did not properly check for boopsi
  images as menu labels, and hence crashed as soon
  as it was attempted to use them.

Changes for release 47.1 (19.5.2019):

- The FrameIClass supports now a new frame type, the context
  boxes. This is used by GadTools for the new bevel boxes.

- Added a new flag to CreateGadgetA(), NG_GRIDLAYOUT, which
  positions and scales gadgets to multiplies of the font
  box size, with a resolution of 1/4 of font height and font
  width.

Changes for release 47.2 (30.5.2019):

- Some programs leave junk in ng_Flags and then trigger
  erraneously the font scaling algorithm. The scaler now attempts
  to detect such junk and disables itself upon its detection.

Changes for release 47.3 (20.7.2019):

- Added the tags GTVI_MinFontWidth and GTVI_MinFontHeight to
  specify minimum design dimensions for SetDesignFont().

Changes for release 47.4 (26.1.2020):

- If GTMX_Active overrun the number of gadgets, gadtools could
  create a hit. It now activates the last gadget in the group.

Changes for release 47.5 (26.1.2020):

- Fix so the Shift key in menus is now shown correctly.

Changes for release 47.6 (12.5.2020):

- Implement true OS level support for scrollwheel

Changes for release 47.7 (23.5.2020):

- GadTools allocates GTST_MaxChars for gadgets of STRING_KIND
  plus an extra char for the cursor. It also copied an extra
  char into the buffer via SetGadgetAttr() when GTST_String
  was specified, which resulted in overlength strings not being
  truncated properly.

Changes for release 47.8 (31.5.2020):

- The "�" character (ASCII 187) is no longer used to indicate menu items
  with a sub-menu. Rather, a flag is set in the MenuItem structure which
  tells Intuition to display a proper sub-menu mark.

- Added support for the new MENUMX and MENUSUB sysiclass images as part
  of the menu layout computations.

- The menu layout is now done in such a way that menu items are never
  shorter than the tallest of the standard menu glyphs.

- The value of the BBFT_CTXTFRAME constant in libraries/gadtools.h has
  been changed due to a conflict with the OS 4.x API. It keeps being the
  same as FRAME_CONTEXT (from intuition/imageclass.h), which was changed
  as well.

Changes for release 47.9 (09.6.2020):

- Fix potential crash dereferencing a nullptr

Changes for release 47.10 (4.10.2020):

- The menu layout code wasn't always reserving enough room for the shift
  key symbol; now fixed (bug #1845).

Changes for release 47.11 (9.12.2020):

- Scrollers and sliders now feature 3D-style embossed knobs and a darker
  container background when intuition.library is version 47.44 or higher.

Changes for release 47.12 (22.12.2020):

- Scroller and slider knobs are now drawn in selected state when clicked
  upon and dragged with the mouse.

- Listview scrollers now always have square arrow buttons (corrected for
  screen aspect ratio), instead of having buttons as tall as list items,
  which could yield weird results with very large or very small fonts.

- The GTSC_Arrows tag now supports the special -1 value, meaning "square
  arrow buttons". If used, the button size may still be adjusted so that
  it doesn't exceed 1/4th of the scroller's length.

- Arrow buttons taller than 11 pixels now put an extra pixel of vertical
  padding above and below their inner arrow symbol, in an effort to make
  it a little more pleasing to the eye.

Changes for release 47.13 (1.1.2021):

- DrawBevelBoxA() now passes IA_Label and IA_LabelPen to frameiclass, in
  place of IA_Data and IA_FGPen (see also Intuition 47.47's releasenotes
  for more information about the reasons for this change).

- Added the new read-only GTLV_Total and GTLV_Visible attributes.

- Added the new GTMX_ScaledSpacing attribute, to be used in grid layouts.

Changes for release 47.14 (19.01.2021):

- Reverted a prototype change for slider gadget which would break legacy
  apps which peek the gadget's structure directly (PCx/Fusion)


gadtools 47.15 (21.1.2021)

- Updated the AutoDocs to describe the function set through the
  GTSL_DispFunc tag in more detail, especially how parameters are
  passed to it.

- Fixed a compiler warning.

- No functional changes.


gadtools 47.16 (20.2.2021)

- The MIF_SHIFTCOMMSEQ now also applies to command strings
