------------------------- AmigaOS 4 project --------------------------

bevel.image 46.1 (19.02.2002)

- initial release for AmigaOS4.

bevel.image 50.1 (28.4.2002)

- bumped the version number to 50.

- made some adjustments to the OM_GET method for the BEVEL_InnerTop,
  BEVEL_InnerWidth and BEVEL_InnerHeight attributes.

- removed the useless inner transparent border of BVS_BOX frames.

bevel.image 50.2 - 50.53

- internal development versions, never released.

bevel.image 50.54 (5.7.2002)

- first release for testing, with support of Intuition V50. The look
  of the bevels is now directly based on frameiclass, and configurable
  by way of the new GUI preferences editor.

bevel.image 50.55 (29.8.2002)

- fixed a very old bug which could cause RectFill() to be called with
  invalid arguments.

bevel.image 50.56 (31.8.2002)

- added even more safety checks against the possibility of drawing a
  rectangle with invalid coordinates.

bevel.image 50.57 (20.9.2002)

- now supports the new "realistic shading" features of Intuition for
  hicolor and truecolor screens.

bevel.image 50.58 (14.10.2002)

- no longer calls OpenDiskFont() if not running in the context of a
  process.

------------------------ AmigaOS 3.2 project -------------------------

bevel.image 50.59 (18.8.2019)

- Notice that v50.59 reflects only a transitional status between the 
  OS4 and 3.2 projects.
  
- fixed race condition when opening/closing.

- now runs on 68000/68010.

bevel.image 47.1 (1.9.2019):

- recompiled with data=far and utllib to improve
  the code generation.

bevel.image 47.2 (29.11.2019)

- Re-added support for OS 3.5/3.9 ReAction frame styles. "GadTools",
  however, is still being mapped to frameiclass for consistency with
  the actual GadTools.

- Removed a number of compiler and optimizer warnings.

- Bevels with a right-justified label no longer draw the text in the
  wrong position (one pixel too many to the left).

- Borderless (BVS_NONE) bevels no longer put padding around the text.

- Selected BVS_BOX bevels no longer draw their border with SHINEPEN
  if they are not transparent; the different background color should
  be enough of a visual cue as to the bevel's selected state.

bevel.image 47.3 (01.jan.2020)

- Fixed that frameiclass gadtools themed bevels were miscalculated

bevel.image 47.4 (19.jan.2020)

- Fixed: group boxes were being overlapped by their contents.

bevel.image 47.5 (4.3.2020)

- Now avoids using IM_FRAMEBOX when calculating bevel thicknesses
  (as IM_FRAMEBOX adds a variable amount of space).

bevel.image 47.6 (8.3.2020)

- Now reports correct bevel dimensions for BVT_THICK buttons.

bevel.image 47.7 (29.3.2020)

- Fixed: bevels were drawn with the wrong pens in some situations.

- Removed dead code.

bevel.image 47.8 (31.3.2020)

- Now reports correct bevel dimensions for BVT_THIN and BVT_XENTHIN
  buttons.

- String gadgets etc. no longer have grey dots near top right and
  bottom left corners.

bevel.image 47.9 (9.4.2020)

- Now TEXTPEN is always used for BVS_FIELD labels.

bevel.image 47.10 (15.4.2020)

- Now BVS_STANDARD bevels are rendered at 1*1 thickness for
  BVT_XENTHIN.

bevel.image 47.11 (30.4.2020)

- Changed default bevel style from BVS_GROUP to BVS_BUTTON, to
  match with autodocs (and behaviour on OS4).

- No longer draws outside its boundaries.

- Improved horizontal text positioning.

bevel.image 47.12 (13.11.2020)

- Streamlined and cleaned up a little some parts of the code that had
  become way too complex and hard to follow over the years. This has
  no impact on functionality but makes the sources (hopefully) easier
  to maintain and reduces the binary size.

- BVS_FIELD bevels in "Thick" style were missing a white pixel in the
  top right corner of the inner border; now fixed.

- BVS_FIELD bevels in "Thin", "XEN" and "Thin XEN" style wouldn't be
  drawn ghosted when in disabled state; now fixed.

- The support for BVS_CONTAINER, BVS_KNOB and BVS_DISPLAY bevel types
  is now complete. Furthermore, the FRAME_PROPBORDER, FRAME_PROPKNOB,
  FRAME_DISPLAY and FRAME_CONTEXT frameiclass types are recognized as
  values for IA_FrameType and converted to the matching bevel types.

- "GadTools" style bevels now use frameiclass' FRAME_CONTEXT type (if
  available) for BVS_GROUP, BVS_SBAR_HORIZ and BVS_SBAR_VERT; this is
  more consistent with OS 3.2 GadTools GUIs and all other RA styles.
  Also, it fixes a bug in rendering of BVS_SBAR_HORIZ (no 3D effect).

- IM_FRAMEBOX now supports the new FRAMEF_MINIMAL flag, which asks an
  image not to include any additional padding in the method's result.
  This is an alternative way to get the border sizes that also allows
  to provide context information (DrawInfo) to the query.

bevel.image 47.13 (22.12.2020)

- Selected BVS_KNOB images are no longer drawn with a recessed frame.

- It's now possible to set and read the new IA_Orientation attribute,
  although the class itself doesn't use it for anything yet (however,
  subclasses could).
