----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------
  
Changes for 47.1 (25.05.2019):

- Made the GUI scalable.

Changes for 47.2 (08.06.2019):

- The program uses now the default tool icon for iconification
  if it cannot find its own icon.

- In case the font is smaller than 8x8, the GUI falls back to
  topaz.8.

- Fixed a bug in the startup code that could have caused crashes.

- No longer uses sprintf from the amiga.lib.

Changes for 47.6 (05.08.2019):

- Small fixes for current (V46) build gui mess.

Changes for 47.7 (09.08.2019):

- Removed IDCMP IntuiTicks

- Added processing of text Gadgets when activating Use/Save, so users
  don't need to confirm strings by hitting Return/Enter anymore.
  
Changes for 47.8 (20.08.2019): 

- Added GUI to create and insert Title Format Items easily.

- An empty TitleFormatString will now be replaced with the system 
  default on exit.
  
Changes for 47.9 (20.08.2019): 

- Title Format Items are now inserted at Cursor position.

- Program will now trigger a DisplayBeep in case user tries to insert 
  a Title Format Item into a full buffer.

Changes for 47.10 (21.08.2019): 

- The TitleFormatWizard inserted wrong version TFIs.

- Restored default for Workbench Title Update Delay to the traditional 
  value of five seconds. 

Changes for 47.11 (24.08.2019): 

- Added support for additional Title Format Items

- Accomodated default Title Update Delay to new update base tick (1 s)

Changes for 47.12 (26.08.2019): 

- "NewIcons" support is now enabled by default.

Changes for 47.14 (10.09.2019): 

- Sub-Window for Title Format item has been redesigned:
  - now fits onto default Hires screen
  - uses same gadgets as the OS4 version
  - no longer has a closegadget

- Title Format string will be set to system default, 
  if no workbench.prefs exists in ENV:

- Loading V44/V45 prefs will no longer cause an error requester

- Default title update interval is now the classic 5 seconds

- Small changes to gui layout

- Main window now has smart refresh to avoid damage while sub-window
  is open.

Changes for 47.15 (28.09.2019):

- The main window and the wizard for the title bar setup can now be
  clicked into simulatenously without blocking each other.

- As a side effect, the main window can now be simplerefresh again.

- The iconification gadget iconifies both windows.

- Restoring or loading the last defaults restores now also the hidden
  device list and the workbench title string.

Changes for 47.16 (12.10.2019):

- The ENV-Gadget was created in disabled state, thus was not reachable
  once the window was left.

Changes for 47.17 (08.01.2020):

- Opens custom screen if gui does not fit on WB

Changes for 47.18 (9.01.2020):

- Added support for the new V47+ help system. The common PrefsEd 
  code will now scan HELP:<mylocale>/sys/Prefs/<PrefsEdName>.guide 
  for an AmigaGuide document which offers a documentation of the 
  respective Preference editor. 
  If unsuccessful, it'll search for a fallback in HELP:english/sys/.

- Replaced all custom string functions with UtilityLib's
  SNPrintf()/Strncpy() et al.

- Some cleanups.

Changes for 47.19 (28.04.2020):

- Adjusted MSG_WB_TITLEUPDATEDELAY_GAD location.

Changes for 47.20 (19.5.2020):

- Rebuilt with the small data model. And this time it's serious.

Changes for 47.21 (13.7.2020):

- Added a new cycle gadget in the "Appearance" section, allowing to 
  select where to place drawer names in "view by text" drawers (mixed 
  with files, before all files, or after all files).
  This requires at least workbench.library 47.19 and IPrefs 47.15 to 
  work.

Changes for 47.22 (27.7.2020):

- The device of the volume to which SYS: is being assigned to will now 
  be excluded from the list of hidden devices. This prevents users 
  from hiding their boot device.

Changes for 47.23 (30.8.2020)

- When building the list of file system devices which the user may want
  Workbench to hide, the list is now built while the DosList is locked
  first and gets filtered only after the DosList has been unlocked.

- Excluding the file system device which the SYS: assignment is bound
  to from the list of devices to hide now makes sure that SYS: is
  definitely an assignment and not maybe a volume or device name.

- Before copying the device name, the code which builds the list of
  devices to hide now checks for an unlikely buffer overflow. Also,
  memory allocation failure is tested early on so as to avoid
  an unlikely Enforcer hit.

- When filtering the list of likely file system devices to hide,
  AmigaDOS requesters are now blocked. This avoids showing one if a
  device currently has no medium present. We check specifically for
  the ERROR_DEVICE_NOT_MOUNTED error code and assume that a file
  system is involved.

Changes for 47.24 (31.8.2020)

- Actually adding the device names to the list of devices which
  may be up for hiding should make this work much better :-/

Changes for 47.25 (13.9.2020)

- Only save title string if different from default. This way default 
  strings can be kept localized. User edited strings are never 
  overwritten.
  
Changes for 47.26 (25.9.2020)

- Fix a bug in previous change where the default default string was 
  incorrect.

Changes for 47.27 (01.12.2020)

- Added proper scaling to checkmark gadget (hide titlebar option).

Changes for 47.28 (06.12.2020)

- HideTitlebar controls were originally meant to be represented by a cycle
  gadget, resulting in its checkbox gadget not being initialized properly
  at the start of the program.
  
Changes for 47.29 (11.12.2020)

- Modified Listview scrollers' width to match other OS
  applications'.

Changes for 47.30 (05.01.2021)

- Applied new GTMX_ScaledSize to radio buttons and adapted the GUI accordingly.

Changes for 47.31 (20.01.2021)

- Reworked the layout to make more space for some languages.

Changes for 47.32 (24.3.2021)

- Fix for bug #2003. No longer crashes if gadtools.library cannot be opened.
