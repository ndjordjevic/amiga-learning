-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

Installer 43.4 (22.12.2016)

- Converted assembly language portions (inst.a and xliba.a) to 'C'.

- Added compiler-specific header file to ease compilation with GCC
  and CLANG.

- Removed RCS targets from SAS/C smakefile.

instsum 43.1 (22.12.2016)

- The lost Installer utility command returns.

- Now requires Kickstart 2.04 to run.

- Added a version string.

- Slightly rewritten to use FRead() instead of Read().

Installer 43.5 (24.12.2016)

- Removed all the assembly language files, including the
  header files they would need.

- Added "text.h" to the repository so that Installer may be
  rebuilt without needing CatComp.

Installer 43.6 (24.12.2016)

- Fixed compiler warnings related to uninitialized variables
  and memory being freed twice.

- Memory allocations are now being performed only through
  memory pools.

Installer 43.7 (5.1.2017)

- The GETDISKSPACE command now handles numeric overflow
  resulting from multiplying the number of blocks available
  for allocation by the number of bytes per block more
  robustly. If the product turns out to be a negative number
  or just smaller than any of the factors, it will pretend
  that there are about 2 Gigabytes of storage space available
  on the volume.

Installer 43.8 (7.1.2017)

- Further tinkering with GETDISKSPACE, to the effect that the
  number of blocks available and number of blocks used are now
  cast as unsigned 32 bit integers. This is to avoid trouble
  with volumes larger than 1 Terabyte, for with the number of
  blocks used can tip from being a signed 32 bit integer > 0
  to become a negative integer.

Installer 43.10 (13.1.2018)

- Could squeeze out another 2K by removing some compiler
  overhead. No functional changes.
  
Installer 43.11 (14.1.2018)

- Recompiled again without utillib as it crashes on some
  home-made 68060 boards without the boot-ROM.

Installer 45.1 (8.4.2018)

- The installer swaps now the stack in case it finds its
  initial stack size too small.

Installer 45.3 (21.5.2018)

- In case the substr() function was given a negative length,
  it could have overwritten memory. substr() returns now an
  empty string in case the length is negative.

- The installer allocates now longer buffers for strings,
  and checks buffer sizes before copying strings.

Installer 45.4 (23.5.2018)

- Found another potential out of bounds access when creating
  the list of devices.

- Fixed the file names overrunning the right edge of the file
  requester.

Installer 45.5 (26.5.2018)

- The computation of the maximum disk space could still
  overflow, giving bogus results.

- The @installer-version identifies this installer version as
  #43 to avoid problems with scripts expecting functions from
  the 3.9 installer not present in this version.

- Found two other places in the code where computations on
  the block count from InfoData could overflow on large devices
  and fixed them (hopefully).
  
Installer 45.6 (27.8.2018)

- The protect() command now also supports the "h" (hold)
  protection bit.
  
Installer 45.7 (4.1.2019)

- The DiskType() function did not check beforehand whether it
  was talking to a file handler and may have send an
  ACTION_DISK_INFO to some handlers that hickup seriously on
  this packet. 

Installer 45.8 (18.2.2019)

- Removed a couple of dead functions, in an attempt to make
  the installer shorter.

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

Installer 47.1 (14.9.2019)

- Added Windowclose-Gadget. For the third and hopefully last
  time in the history of this program.

- Added support for the OS3.9 Installer statements "openwbobj",
  "showwbobj" and "closewbobj".

Installer 47.2 (18.9.2019)

- Added support for the OS3.9 Installer statement "reboot"

- Prepared support for the OS3.9 Installer statements "showmedia", 
  "setmedia", "closemedia" and "effect". They don't work, yet, but
  will be ignored upon execution of a script.

Installer 47.3 (29.9.2019)

- Statements "openwbobj", "showwbobj" and "closewbobj" are now being 
  recognized by their correct names: "openwbobject", "showwbobject" 
  and "closewbobject". Don't comment, please.

- Installer features limited to OS V39+ or V44+ will be ignored, 
  depending on the revision of the user's machine.
  
Installer 47.4 (16.10.2019)

- In case the installer was run from disk, but APPNAME was not set,
  the startup code created a hit.

Installer 47.5 (24.10.2019)

- Symbol name search did not use proper ISO-latin case-insensitive
  comparison. Only ASCII worked.

Installer 47.6 (29.10.2019)

- The word wrapping algorithm strangely repeated the last character
  if no suitable position for splitting up the text was found.

Installer 47.7 (22.11.2019)

- @installer-version identifies Installer as version 47 again; 
  missing OS3.9 statements will be ignored silently.

Installer 47.8 (27.11.2019)

- Bugfix for @installer-version.
 
Installer 47.9 (6.6.2020)

- Bug 1572: Corrected an issue where a radio button would not display
  if the text wrapped when using certain fonts.

Installer 47.10 (14.6.2020)

- Added support for querydisplay with all querydisplay options
  supported under Installer v44.

Installer 47.11 (16.6.2020)

- Added support for getdiskspace options "B", "K", "M" and "G".

Installer 47.12 (23.6.2020)

- Cursor for requested string in askstring is now placed at the end of
  any default text supplied. Previously the text cursor was at the
  start of the string.

Installer 47.13 (4.7.2020)

- Bug 1572: Options properly centered when the text wraps. Problem
  introduced in 47.9.

Installer 47.14 (8.7.2020)

- ASKCHOICE Options vertically aligned and centred properly.

Installer 47.15 (15.7.2020)

- Reboot command ensures the log file is stored in the requested
  location before rebooting so it is not lost.

Installer 47.16 (23.8.2020)

- Reboot command was executing too soon and potentially corrupting the
  log file. Fixed.

Installer 47.17 (17.9.2020)

- Some checkboxes were still being placed incorrectly. Fixed.

Installer 47.18 (7.11.2020)

- Fixed issue where window would be left blank after displaying help
  text in some circumstances where screen depth > 256 colours.

Installer 47.19 (08.03.2021)

- Bumped (c) year 2021
