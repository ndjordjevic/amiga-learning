-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

Changes for release 45.1 (1.1.2018)

- The 64-bit math routines return now in the 68000 version
  the results in proper order, namely with the low 32 bits
  in register d0 and the high 32 bits in register d1.

- Added 68060 specialized versions of 64bit math. Note that
  these functions are currently never enabled as exec does
  not identify the 68060.

- Improved the 68000 version of SMult64 a tiny little bit.

- Retired the 68020-only version of utility.

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

Changes for release 46.1 (4.8.2019):

- Bumped to V46 to enable automatic loading on Os 3.2.

Changes for release 47.1 (19.8.2019):

- Added a VSNPrintf function for length-limited formatting.

- Added a length-limited strcpy.

- Added a length-limited strcat.

Changes for release 47.2 (12.10.2019):

- Added SDiv64 and UDiv64, both as 68K, 68020 and 68060
  versions.

Changes for release 47.3 (3.2.2020):

- Strncat() wasn't returning NULL as documented when being
  passed a buffer size of zero and a non-NULL destination
  buffer whose first byte was not a NUL. Instead, it would
  append the entire source string to the target and report
  success. Now fixed.

- Passing a NULL source string to Strncpy() and Strncat()
  will no longer cause a crash; NULL is now treated as if
  it were an empty string.

- VSNPrintf() does now use the same LVO and register order
  as its otherwise identical AmigaOS 4.x counterpart; this
  resolves an API conflict and prevents OS 3.2 executables
  calling this function from crashing under OS 4.x.
  Note: the new V50-compatible function is currently just
  a wrapper for the "real" V47 one, which is still present
  (unchanged) at its own LVO to keep existing applications
  working. This may change in a future version, though, so
  please update your include files and recompile programs
  using VSNPrintf() as soon as possible.
