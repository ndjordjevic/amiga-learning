-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

Changes for 45.1 (18.2.2018)

- Recompiled with SAS/C

- Fixed a couple of missing initializers

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

Changes for 47.1 (30.5.2019):

- Made the GUI scalable. Unfortunately
  not the sample, which is hand-drawn.

Changes for 47.2 (8.6.2019):

- The program uses now the default tool icon for iconification
  if it cannot find its own icon.

- In case the font is smaller than 8x8, the GUI falls back to
  topaz.8.

- Fixed a bug in the startup code that could have caused crashes.

Changes for 47.3 (10.6.2019):

- The pen selector cell height is now scaled correctly.

- The boxes within the cell selector are now scaled correctly.

- The palette gadget is now erased before it is redrawn such that
  any left-over gadget art when switching the editing mode is
  cleaned up.

Changes for 47.4 (11.6.2019):

- The palette above the color wheel is now also refreshed when
  the color mode is changed.
  
Changes for 47.5 (15.6.2019):

- Recompiled with a new data architecture.

- When changing the background color, the background of the
  preview was not refreshed.

Changes for 47.6 (11.7.2019):

- Locked the window minimum width to display full sample preview
  when smaller then 8 point wide fonts are used

- Locked custom screenmode minimum width to 640 pixels

Changes for 47.7 (22.7.2019):

- The layout grid is now confined to be at least 8x8 pixels large
  to ensure that graphical elements fit into the window.

- The screen size computation includes now the layout grid size
  constraints.

Changes for 47.8 (4.9.2019):

- The sample is now redrawn on true-color screens.

- Also, palette gadgets and the pen listview are redrawn now.

Changes for 47.9 (29.9.2019):

- Changed the minimum font size back to 8. Design looks questionable
  on 7-pitch.

Changes for 47.10 (13.10.2019):

- Re-rendering the sample on true-color screens was always using the
  8-pen setup, even if the user selected a four-pen setup.

Changes for 47.11 (19.1.2020):

- Added support for the new V47+ help system. The common PrefsEd 
  code will now scan HELP:<mylocale>/sys/Prefs/<PrefsEdName>.guide 
  for an AmigaGuide document which offers a documentation of the 
  respective Preference editor. 
  If unsuccessful, it'll search for a fallback in HELP:english/sys/.

- Replaced most custom string functions with UtilityLib's
  SNPrintf()/Strncpy() et al.

- The calculation of the fallback custom screen's width & height
  was eaten by the compiler's optimizer.

- Some cleanups.

Changes for 47.12 (26.1.2020):

- Compressed the gui a little bit to fit 640x200 screens

Changes for 47.13 (30.03.2020):

- Small workaround for preview of sceen drag bar with VisualPrefs

Changes for 47.14 (19.4.2020):

- Added full MagicWB colour palette preset

- Fix corruption of system font - code was modifying read-only font 
  structures

Changes for 47.15 (19.5.2020)

- Rebuilt with the small data model. And this time it's serious.

Changes for 47.16 (31.5.2020)

- Added support for the already existing BARTRIMPEN and the new 
  BARCONTOURPEN, which enable the user to customize the look of screen 
  bar and menu borders.

- The color wheel is now circular also on widescreen display modes, 
  instead of being stretched horizontally. RTG display modes are 
  assumed to always have a square aspect ratio for their pixels.

- The fake DrawInfo structure passed to the routines rendering the 
  preview had its reserved fields left uninitialized, so they would 
  contain garbage which could crash newer versions of Intuition in 
  case those fields were eventually put to use. Now they're properly 
  initialized to zero instead.

- Fixed some small inaccuracies in the preview rendering routines.

Changes for 47.17 (04.10.2020)

- Added various new presets to support thin and 3D menu styles 
- Added a Kick 1.3-alike preset

Changes for 47.18 (12.10.2020)

- Fix preview rendering of color presets were wrong if you changed
  between certain presets

Changes for 47.19 (18.10.2020)

- Another preview fix. The RTG preset was using the wrong pens.

Changes for 47.20 (25.12.2020)

- Corrected size of scroller to match other prefs default 18 pixels

Changes for 47.21 (24.3.2021)

- Fix for bug #2003. No longer crashes if gadtools.library cannot be opened.
