join 47.2 (7.1.2021)

- Before calling MatchFirst(), the AnchorPath structure passed to
  is always cleared and reinitialized. This is necessary because
  the AnchorPath structure is reused for all the files or directories
  which may need to be copied and the last call to MatchNext() may
  have set flags which are still set when MatchFirst() is called
  again.
