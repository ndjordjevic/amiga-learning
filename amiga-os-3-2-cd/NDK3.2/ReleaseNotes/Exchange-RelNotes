Changes for release 47.5 (4.6.2020):

  blowing up AmigaGuide when hiding the application window.

- Replaced accesses to SysBase->ThisTask with FindTask(NULL)

Changes for release 47.6 (11.6.2020):

- The signal mask was set up outside the main loop hence it would
  ignore signals from the IDCMP port if the Commodity was started
  with CX_POPUP=NO and the window openend later. (Fixes bug #1595)

Changes for release 47.7 (2.9.2020):

- AmigaGuide stuff is now initialized/disposed when the window is being 
  created or closed (moved code to CreateWindow() / back to 
  DisposeWindow())

- Increased max info description length to 39 chars (was 37)
  So a few rare commodities with longer strings get a little more 
  space 39 chars is limit set somewhere for this data.
