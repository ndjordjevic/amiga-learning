Changes for V45.6 (30.12.2016)

- mathieeesingbas is no longer a ROM library, but is supposed to be
disk-based, as all (most) other math libraries.

- lowered the priority of mathieeesingbas so it is not automatically
initialized even if loaded resident. This is intentional and avoids
situations where singbas is initialized before the FPU becomes
available through setpatch.

- integrated all versions (020,000,FPU) into one version.

- The 020 version is *not* used in case a 040 or 060 is in the system.
This is because it includes instructions the 060 cannot execute without
setpatch, and even then the 000 version is faster.

- Added a magic libbase replacement that automatically switches the
library base if the math hardware changes, for example through 
setpatch. No need for setpatch to play with the library base anymore.

Changes for V45.7 (2.1.2017)

- Apparently, the magic library replacement could have resulted in
situations where the dead library base is removed while some programs
are still using it, and hence causing a crash. This happens only if
a program re-opens the math.library, but does not update its internal
pointers, and then closes the library through the old, non-updated
pointer, finally pulling the rug under its feed. Arexx seem to be
notorious about this, but other programs may exist that assume that
the library base stays constant. Thus, to avoid any further trouble,
the obsolete library stays resident in memory forever, causing a slight
loss of memory.

Changes for V45.8 (6.5.2018)

- Due to a misconfigured assembler, some harmless code was only runable
  on a 68020 or beyond. Fixed that.

Changes for V45.9 (16.7.2018)

- The rounding mode for mathieeesingbas was changed to round to zero,
  full precision. This is to make the code consistent with the CPU
  code, and to allow parallel usage of the singbas and doubbas
  library.

Changes for V45.10 (28.4.2019):

- The rounding mode for the CPU code was also changed to "round to zero".

Changes made for V47.1 (5.5.2019):

- The rounding mode changed consistently to "round to nearest", 
  including the CPU code. This is a fully IEEE-aware rounding mode 
  with "round to even", including the support for round bit, guard bit 
  and sticky bit.
