------------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project ------------------------

Changes for release 47.1 (15.6.2019):

- Recompiled with new startup code.

Changes for release 47.2 (19.5.2020):

- Replaced stricmp() with utility.library's version

Changes for release 47.3 (4.6.2020):

- Moved the CloseAmigaGuide stuff out of DisposeWindow() to avoid
  blowing up AmigaGuide when hiding the application window.

- Replaced accesses to SysBase->ThisTask with FindTask(NULL)

- Changed major version in GNUMakefile to 47 to keep make version 
  happy

Changes for release 47.4 (11.6.2020):

- The signal mask was set up outside the main loop hence it would
  ignore signals from the IDCMP port if the Commodity was started
  with CX_POPUP=NO and the window openend later. (Fixes bug #1595)

Changes for release 47.5 (12.7.2020):

- Added new TOBACK_QUALIFIER option allowing to select a qualifier for
  sending windows to back (with a single click). Defaults to LEFT_ALT.
  If set to NONE, or to the same value as the regular QUALIFIER option,
  the "send to back" functionality is deactivated.

- No longer brings Workbench windows to the front when double-clicking
  on an icon, since that's typically not what the user wants (requires
  workbench.library 47.19 or higher).

Changes for release 47.6 (31.8.2020):

- AmigaGuide stuff is now initialized/disposed when the window is 
  being created or closed (moved code to CreateWindow() / back to 
  DisposeWindow())
