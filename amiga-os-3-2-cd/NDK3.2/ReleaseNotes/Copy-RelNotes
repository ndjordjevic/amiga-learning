-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

Changes for release 45.1 (11.7.2018)

- Recompiled with SAS/C

- The maximum buffer size for file names is now larger

- Removed a bogus file name buffer extension - path names
  cannot grow longer than 255 characters in AmigaOs due to
  BCPL legacy reasons.

- Copy caused the file system(s) to crash in case it
  attempts to copy a softlink. Copy should really follow
  the link instead of just crashing.
  
Changes for release 45.2 (15.7.2018)

- The previous release worked really strange on softlinks
  and hardlinks as it failed to copy them at all, skipped
  them or forgot to copy their contents. Also, it messed
  with the DirEntryType of the FileInfoBlock and hence
  may have confused file systems considerably. This release
  follows the workbench and re-creates links as links to
  the same object, or a link of the same path.

Changes for release 45.3 (9.8.2018)

- By not setting the CurrentDir() correctly in case the source
  was not a directory nor a pattern, copy created the target
  in the wrong place.

- Cleaned up the spaghetti code a bit more. As a result, we got
  shorter again...

Changes for release 45.4 (9.12.2018)

- In case somebody tried to copy the file name '*', Copy would
  have attempted to copy from the console instead. Copy checks
  now the wildstar flag in the dos library root node and
  substitutes * with #? if it is set, otherwise fails.

Changes for release 45.5 (21.4.2019):

- Error messages are now printed over pr_CES.

Changes for release 45.7 (11.7.2019):

- Copy did not release its copy buffer.

Changes for release 47.1 (19.9.2019):

- Added the FORCE keyword to overwrite protected targets.

Changes for release 47.2 (22.11.2019):

- Copy now also copies metadata (protection bits, file notes)
  of directories.

Changes for release 47.3 (24.11.2019):

- When copying metadata, Copy always used the source name of
  the object as target of the metadata change, not the name
  of the target object which may be different.

Changes for release 47.4 (7.1.2020):

- Some filesystems, most notably the FFS, cannot set the metadata
  of an exclusively locked object. Thus, again some change in
  the metadata adjustment.


copy 47.5 (7.1.2021)

- Before calling MatchFirst(), the AnchorPath structure passed to
  is always cleared and reinitialized. This is necessary because
  the AnchorPath structure is reused for all the files or directories
  which may need to be copied and the last call to MatchNext() may
  have set flags which are still set when MatchFirst() is called
  again.


copy 47.6 (7.1.2021)

- Oh bother, "copy" calls MatchFirst() in two different places...


Copy 47.7 (30.01.2021)

- Removed double $VER: strings, migrated to newer VERSTAG
