----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

Changes for release 45.1 (13.4.2019):

- Recompiled with SAS/C.

- This version no longer uses the locale.library, as there
  are no localized strings in first place, and no strings
  worth localizing either.

- Uses now ACTION_UNDISK_INFO to ensure that AUTO windows
  can be closed again after using the program.


Changes for release 47.1 (28.11.2019)

- Bumped to v47.

- Minor optimizations.
