----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

getcolor.gadget 47.1 (3.3.2020)

- Backported from AmigaOS 4 version 53.6.

- On CLUT screens, the color box displayed in the requester wasn't
  being updated in real time while doing changes; now fixed.

- On CLUT screens, the color displayed by the gadget itself wasn't
  being updated after changing it with the requester; now fixed.

getcolor.gadget 47.2 (5.3.2020)

- Localized strings are now coming from classes.catalog instead of
  prefs.catalog.

  than just "Color".

getcolor.gadget 47.3 (6.3.2020)

- The requester's color display box is now a space.gadget subclass.
  This allows to override the OM_SET method so that the gadget can
  pass REACTION_SpecialPens to the image used as its frame; it was
  being rendered with partially incorrect colors in Thick, XEN and
  Thin XEN styles.

- Reworked and cleaned up the color requester sources a little.

getcolor.gadget 47.4 (24.5.2020)

  does not go off the rails if asked to look up a string ID value
  which is not stored in the local CatCompBlock data lump.

getcolor.gadget 47.5 (16.6.2020)

- Now runs on 68000/68010.
