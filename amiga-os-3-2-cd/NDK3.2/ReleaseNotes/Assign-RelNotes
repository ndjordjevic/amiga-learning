-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

Changes for release 45.1 (18.11.2017)

- assign was using too much stack

- the maximum length of an assign was limited to 30
  characters, which is not necessary.

- Recompiled with SAS/C and restructured the code.

Changes for release 45.2 (12.4.2019)

- actually, the maximum name length for assign is
  really 30 characters, so changed that back.

Changes for release 45.3 (14.4.2019)

- The buffer handling of assign still had some problems
  because one of the functions missed a return code.

Changes for release 45.4 (19.4.2019)

- Due to an oversight, assign DEFER did not work properly
  and trashed memory.

- Error messages are now printed over pr_CES.

Changes for release 45.7 (22.4.2019)
