-------------------- AmigaOS 3.5/3.9 project -------------------------

RAWBInfo 1.19 (27.10.00)

- disables the "Tooltypes" menu whenever the "Icon" page isn't visible,
  selecting an item from the menu while the page wasn't active ended up
  in a crash. This was actually the fault of texteditor.gadget and
  not RAWBInfo.

- integrated smoothing code from Image2Icon into RAWBInfo.

- dragging icons on the window should work as expected even when DirOpus
  is running, in opposite to the original wb the dropzones won't be
  highlighted when dragging an icon over them (DO is missing the re-
  required functionality).

- rawbinfo lowers its task priority while calculating the size of drawers/
  disks, this way your system doesn't get blocked.

- added I2I=IMAGE2ICON/K,I2IOPTS=IMAGE2ICONOPTS/K options.

- the minimum stacksize that can be entered into the appropiate gadget is
  4096bytes, now (that's the minimum wb allows).

- new ICONFIRST/S option.

- holding down SHIFT while clicking on a tooltype will dis-/enable it (the
  implementation is a bit tricky but it works:).

- disabled "Icon Images / Extras / Delete alternate image" for the time
  BoingBag#2 isn't available (the program actually checks the revision
  number of icon.library before disabling the item).

- it's possible to "tab-cycle" from and to the tooltypes editor, now.

- added shortcuts to the english gadget and menu texts where they were
  missing.

- removed the "Protection:" label in front of the checkboxes, this way
  their shortcuts will work.

- the program makes sure now, that the "Name:" field only contains the
  filepart of the path and not the complete path.

- pressing SHIFT+RETURN inside the tooltypes editor terminates it.

- the program didn't filter system tooltypes (CLI,REXX,TOOLPRI,...)
  correctly, for an example CLICK was identified as CLI.

RAWBInfo 1.20 (31.10.00)

- removed support for gtdrag.library. The library never worked well
  (deadlocks during dragging) and as being an OS component RAWBInfo
  shouldn't need/use any third party product (which is not licensed).

RAWBInfo 1.21 (04.11.00)

- the notification mechanism introduced in 1.18 could crash the program
  when an icon information window was opened in the context of the same
  task more than one time. This only happend when the user saved the
  icon to disk and therefore caused a notification to be sent to the task.
  The next time the user opened an icon information window, the notification
  signal was still set and crashed the program.

- when the size of a drawer is 0 bytes and x blocks, a different formatting
  string is used which only shows the drawer size in blocks. This is what
  the original wb icon information does.

RAWBInfo 1.22 (09.11.00)

- because of a missing function prototype the program threw enforcer hits,
  whenever the user changed an icon (by a different program, eg IconEdit)
  that was shown in the icon information window.

- pasting a transparent image works again as long as RAWBInfo doesn't need
  to scale down the image.

- resizing a window forced a 2nd refresh (bug was introduced in 1.21).

- using the arrows of the Stacksize integer.gadget de-/increases the shown
  value by 1024, now (requires integer.gadget v45).

RAWBInfo 1.23 (16.11.00)

- (de)activating a tooltype by using shift+lmb no longer destroys the
  contents of the clipboard. NOTE: You can only (de)activate a single
  tooltype at a time, now. Thanks to Allan for his help.

- "Icon Images/Frameless?" is now disabled when the icon is a NewIcon.

RAWBInfo 1.24 (20.11.00)

- removed the spacing btw the texteditor.gadget and the scroller.gadget
  that was introduced by fixing window.class.

- added APPICON/S option. when this option is set, the program adds
  an AppIcon on which you can drop other icons to get information on
  them.

- The "Icon Image / Save..." filerequester wasn't set to savemode.

RAWBInfo 1.25 (26.12.00)

- when the user has double-clicked a tooltype (while holding down
  SHIFT), the input-event is no longer passed to the texteditor.gadget.
  Instead the tooltype will be toggled.

- removed some unnecessary spacing between the protection checkboxes.

- when changing the icontype, the default stacksize is taken from
  workbench prefs, now.

RAWBInfo 1.26 (09.01.01)

- holding down SHIFT while dropping an icon over the tooltypes editor
  inserts the tooltypes of the icon.

- disabled underscoring for all non selectable gadgets.

- when a tooltype begins with a non alphanumerical character, the
  character will be ignored when sorting the tooltypes list. So
  enabled and disabled tooltypes will appear mixed in the list instead
  of having the disabled tooltypes at the top.

RAWBInfo 1.27 (05.03.01)

- when the object on which information is shown is a link, its name
  will be underlined.

- After one hour of debugging trying to find out why each information
  window ate 65kb of memory I found the reason: the OM_NEW method of
  the icon gadget called OM_SET and OM_SET called the OM_NEW method
  of the superclass and the superclass ... A really stupid mistake.
  Somebody please give me a kick in my [censored].

- should handle WBDISK icons correctly even when they aren't named disk.

- the "Protection: " label in front of the checkboxes is back, again.
  Please note that you need label.image 45.1 to keep their shortcuts
  "alive".

RAWBInfo 1.28 (30.03.01)

- fixed mungwall damage caused by passing a string to button.gadget
  that was allocated on the stack.

RAWBInfo 1.29 (11.04.01)

- dropping an disk icon (or any other type of icon without tooltypes)
  on the tooltypes editor could crash the machine.

RAWBInfo 1.30 (18.04.01)

- when DefIcons is running the filetype will be displayed, now.

RAWBInfo 1.31 (30.04.01)

- fixed icon display problem introduce in 1.30.

RAWBInfo 1.32 (03.06.01)

- "Icon Images / Extra / Delete alternate image" was always ghosted
  on a system with icon.library v45.

RAWBInfo 1.33 (03.08.01)

- it's possible to change the name of an icon, now. A new string
  (MSG_NAME_FMT2) has been added to the catalog.

RAWBInfo 1.34 (08.08.01)

- double-clicking the icon will "c:wbrun" the file (allows to view
  image files this way).

- the icon name can be changed by drag'n'drop, now.

- when saving an icon back to disk, only the information that has
  been changed (this includes the comment, the protection bits and
  the filename) will be saved.

RAWBInfo 1.35 (31.08.01)

- removed some experimental code that made it into the last release
  by mistake.

- reworked the rename code.

RAWBInfo 1.36 (26.05.02)

- When PoolMem is installed and with icons being in chipram, the
  image duplication feature failed.

- Changes to the tooltypes are detected even when only the case of
  a character has changed.

RAWBInfo 1.37 (03.06.02)

- fixed enforcer hits when saving tooltypes-less (= NULL pointer)
  back to disk.

RAWBInfo 1.38

- ???

------------------------ AmigaOS 4 project --------------------------- 

RAWBInfo 1.39 (11.06.03)

- fixed tooltypes editor.

RAWBInfo 1.40 (15.08.03)

- increased minimum size of stacksize and name gadgets.

- ported to ppc.

RAWBInfo 1.41 (25.02.04)

- Adapted some GUI details to better support the OS4 default look.

- Added a new menu item to save a default icon immediately, using
  the detected type of its associated file as name (example: for
  a pdf file, it will save "def_pdf.info").

- For drawer and trashcan icons, the "Icon" page does now feature
  two choosers allowing to select the "Show" and "View by" mode.

- When DefIcons is running, the type will now be displayed above
  the icon image in all cases (not just tools and projects), for
  better consistency. Also, if the icon doesn't have a real file
  or directory associated to it, the type (taken from the .info
  file) is now displayed in parentheses.

- Filesystem notifications on the current icon should now cause
  much less flicker, especially if the icon size has not changed.

- The snapshot coordinates of an icon are now displayed below the
  icon image. You can turn this off with the new NOSHOWPOS switch.

- Added a new NOWORDWRAP switch to turn off word wrapping in the
  tool type editing area (requires texteditor.gadget V50).

- For tool and project icons, the gadgets in the "Icon" page that
  are constructed from tool types are now reset to default values
  when a filesystem notification on the current icon occurs and
  the newly read icon has an empty tool type array.

RAWBInfo 1.42 (4.3.2004)

- Fixed a bug that would lead to varargs button gadgets not being
  updated correctly on PPC.

- The creation date of a volume is now displayed properly again.

RAWBInfo 1.43 (16.5.2004)

- When deleting an icon that lives in a "show all files" window,
  the corresponding default icon does now show up automatically.

- Added a new requester type for disk icons not associated to a
  volume (requires workbench.library 51.3+ to be useful).

- The PPC version is now an ELF EXEC file, and fully stripped.

RAWBInfo 1.44 (3.7.2004)

- added horizontal scroller when NoWordWrap/S is used.

- fixed crash when selecting "Previous" from the "Project" menu.

- now using requester.class.

RAWBInfo 1.45 (6.7.2004)

- oops! vertical scrolling didn't work anymore when NoWordWrap
  was used.

RAWBInfo 1.46 (24.9.2005)

- "disk.info" is named "Disk.info", now.

- the coordinate display below the icon could throw some MemGuard hits.

RAWBInfo 1.47 (17.10.2005)

- The HookEntry() 68k stub is now in C.

- Replaced tolower() with ToLower() which works without startup code.

- No longer allocates MEMF_PUBLIC memory.

- Now builds with gcc 4.0.0 with -Wall -Werror.

RAWBInfo 1.48 (19.10.2005)

- fixed a buffer overflow.

RAWBInfo 1.49 (7.11.2005)

- Changed some EasyRequesters to TimedDosRequesters.

- Added the tags OC_BuiltInLanguage, OC_BuiltInCodeSet, REQ_CharSet,
  TDR_CharSet, GTMN_CharSet, WINDOW_CharSet, LAYOUT_CharSet to display the
  requesters, menus and GUI in catalog charset.

RAWBInfo 1.50 (20.11.2005)

- (re)added NULL-Pointer check to "Remap 1.3/2.0" function.

RAWBInfo 1.51 (04.12.2005)

- fixed crash when selecting "Previous" from the "Project" menu.

RAWBInfo 1.52 (07.12.2005)

- fixed some MemGuard hits (grrr, I hate button.gadget ;-)

RAWBInfo 1.53 (9.12.2005)

- added GM_EXTENT support to the internal texteditor.gadget subclass.

RAWBInfo 1.54 (23.12.2005)

- Changed path to find the catalog to the "sys" sub-directory (for consistency)

RAWBInfo 1.55 (28.2.2006)

- Changed IconEdit path from SYS:Tools/ to SYS:Utilities/.

- Updated the "About" requester.

RAWBInfo 1.56 (28.2.2006)

- fixed calculation of drawer size.

- added support for files larger than 4gb (untested).

RAWBInfo 1.57 (1.4.2006)

- when copying a traditional icon image (struct Image *), too much data
  was read from the source.

RAWBInfo 1.58 (7.4.2006)

- fixed bug introduced by 1.41 (button.gadget crashing when displaying
  icon coordinates).

RAWBInfo 1.59 (16.8.2006)

- added support for the new native truecolor icon format introduced in
  icon.library 51.15. Note: you need also picture.datatype 51.7+ and
  ilbm.datatype 51.3+ for the copy, paste, and save image functions to
  work in an useful way with truecolor icon images.

- changing an icon image with drag and drop was temporarily allocating
  much more memory than needed, with the actual amount depending on the
  palette size; now fixed.

- fixed a couple of memory leaks that happened when changing an icon's
  image with drag and drop or with the "Icon Image/Restore" menu item.

- when selecting the "Save" gadget or menu item, the icon is now always
  written back to disk if the "Drop planar data" or "Drop NewIcons data"
  menu options are checked; this ensures that the requested operation is
  performed in all cases, even if nothing else changed.

- scaling/cropping pictures to make them icon images does now leave any
  surrounding background transparent, if a transparent color is defined
  in the source picture file.

RAWBInfo 1.60 (19.11.2006)

- Now builds with -Wall -Wwrite-strings -Werror.

- No longer calls CreateNewProc() when in Forbid() state when an
  icon is dropped on its window.

RAWBInfo 52.1 (10.12.2006)

- Bumped to V52; no functional changes.

- Now uses <localestr/rawbinfo.h> rather than the local "localestrings.h"
  file.

RAWBInfo 52.2 (16.12.2006)

- The NewReadArgs code crashed when the program icon didnt contain
  any tooltypes, fixed.

RAWBInfo 52.3 (21.12.2006)

- When loading a new image for an icon, the legacy planar data saved into
  the icon file will now represent a four-color version of the new image,
  rather than a full 256-color remap to the current screen palette; that
  would end up using random colors as soon as the screen palette changes.

- The current icon does now get resized when it has only one image and a
  new image is loaded for it that is smaller than the existing image.
  Previously, this would leave the icon size unchanged and just add some
  empty padding around the new smaller image.

- When the icon doesn't have any tool types, the saved icon file will now
  feature a NULL tool type array rather than an array containing a single
  empty string.

- Fixed the truncated version string in the "About" requester.

- Error requesters now use an "error" image, rather than an "info" image.

RAWBInfo 52.4 (30.12.2006)

- Changed two duplicate menu shortcuts: "Icon image/Default" is now "E",
  and "Icon image/Load..." is now "O".

- Changed "Image2Icon" to "Image to icon".

- Fixed the capitalization of a few strings, and adjusted some others to
  make them consistent with Workbench's internal Information requester.

RAWBInfo 52.5 (21.5.2007)

- Now uses a self-opened version of libs.catalog which gets adjusted by
  locale.library to the charset of rawbinfo.catalog. Previous versions
  used datatypes.library/GetDTString(), the strings returned by this
  function could be in the wrong charset or even in the wrong language
  when something opened datatypes.library before IPrefs.

RAWBInfo 52.6 (24.7.2007)

- Now accepts PSIKEY_NFSYS PseudoSegLists which start with "$VER: " in
  ps_Data for the version information of the filesystem used for a volume.
  This fixes the missing filesystem display of FFS volumes. Thanks to
  Ferrán Garcia for the report.

RAWBInfo 52.7 (2.9.2007)

- No longer updates the size gadget several 100 or even 1000 times per
  second but at most 10 times/second.

RAWBInfo 52.8 (19.9.2007)

- Modified the About requester.

RAWBInfo 52.9 (27.11.2007)

- For drawer and trashcan icons, the "Icon" page does now feature two
  new choosers allowing to select the ".info files" show mode and the
  "Sort" order for text mode drawers. This requires workbench.library
  52.9 or higher to be useful.

RAWBInfo 52.10 (25.12.2007)

- One of the latest icon.library fixes did reveal a bug that crept in
  back in RAWBInfo 1.59, due to which generating truecolor icons from
  pictures or from other icons did no longer work. Now fixed.

RAWBInfo 52.11 (8.3.2008)

- Adopted built-in scrollwheel support

RAWBInfo 53.1 (07.09.2009)

- Clicking in the tooltypes area with the shift key held down would
  toggle the current tooltype even when trying to perform an action
  outside of the bounds of that gadget. bug #5457

RAWBInfo 53.2 (24.11.2009)

- When run from the WBStartup preferences, the interface now adapts
  to suit, showing priority, and wait etc.

RAWBInfo 53.3 (29.11.2009)

- Updated the copyright notice.

RAWBInfo 53.4 (07.03.2010)

- Redirected error output to the temporary file when selecting
  "version" as running from WBStartup prefernces with a file
  that did not contain a version string caused a DSI. bug #6349.

- Fixed the "bumprev" makefile rule.

RAWBInfo 53.5 (10.3.2010)

- The "Image to icon" menu option does now work again even with large
  pictures which require scaling or cropping. It used to fail because
  it couldn't open a requester due to a missing tag.

- Replaced the downscaling routine for truecolor pictures with a more
  precise and faster version (the same one used in icon.library).

- Removed a memory leak which would occur when opening an Information
  requester for a drawer or trashcan icon.

- The "Sort" options are now named "Forward" and "Reverse" for better
  consistency with most other system components (they went previously
  under the names "Ascending" and "Descending").

- For drawer and trashcan icons, the "Icon" tab page does now feature
  a new chooser allowing to select the "Previews" on/off state.
  This requires workbench.library 53.25 (the version from beta-tester
  FTP, not the cut down one from Update 1) or higher to be useful.

RAWBInfo 53.6 (21.4.2010)

- No longer displays the "Previews" chooser in the "Icon" tab page if
  workbench.library's version isn't at least 53.26.

- The ".info files" chooser in the "Icon" tab page was not working at
  all due to an incorrect bit shift amount; now fixed.

RAWBInfo 53.7 (10.5.2011)

- Added the ability to lock/unlock volumes (#6961)

RAWBInfo 53.8 (11.9.2011)

- Fixed to not expand paths to full by setting GETFILE_FullFileExpand
  to FALSE when using the getfile.gadget.
  (bug 6241)

- Added mkrelease script.

- Fixed up makefile.os4.

RAWBInfo 53.9 (20.9.2011)

- No longer displays the "Previews" chooser in the "Icon" tab page if
  version.library's version isn't at least 53.9 (i.e. post-Update 4).

- Fixed the capitalization of a couple of strings.

- Updated the year in the copyright text.

- Added the missing trailing ellipsis to the "Project/About" menu item.

- No longer declares the built-in language as "ASCIIenglish", as that
  would trigger bug #4689; it's just "english" again. In order to allow
  opening a disk-based english catalog, { OC_PreferExternal, TRUE } is
  now specified instead in the OpenCatalog() call.

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

RAWBInfo 47.1 (23.6.2020)

- Ported from AmigaOS 4 version 53.9.

- Already prepared for handling of truecolor icons as soon as those are
  supported by icon.library, and 32-bit image data (by clipboard) once
  picture.datatype and its subclasses fully support that.

- Some features of the OS 4.x Workbench are currently disabled, but can
  easily be re-enabled if/when they get added to the OS 3.x Workbench.
  Please don't remove the relevant (commented out) code in the sources!

- Removed the button for locking/unlocking of volumes since the current
  dos.library lacks the function used for that purpose by the V53 code.

- Still to be investigated: seems to be unable to get the specific file
  type (via ARexx) from DefIcons. Therefore, no file type is currently
  displayed above the icon in the Information requester.
  (Addendum: fixed in DefIcons 47.7.)

- Otherwise, functionally equivalent to the AmigaOS 4 version.

RAWBInfo 47.2 (3.7.2020)

- Fixed a few mistakes in the code due to which the build would fail in
  an up-to-date development environment.

- The background of the "State:" read-only button in a disk information
  requester is now properly filled with the ReAction backdrop pattern.

- Adjusted the path of IconEdit from Utilities/IconEdit to 
  Tools/IconEdit.

RAWBInfo 47.3 (13.7.2020)

- For drawer and trashcan icons, the "Icon" page does now feature a new
  chooser allowing to select the "Sort" order for text mode drawers.
  This requires workbench.library 47.19 or higher to be useful.

RAWBInfo 47.4 (13.1.2021)

- Revised gadget layout.
- Removed some dead code.

RAWBInfo 47.5 (22.01.2021)

- added "def_" to default save menu to make it clear what we are saving
  The menu needs to be reworked to save files in deficon english format
  because currently it saves them in locale language without conversion
