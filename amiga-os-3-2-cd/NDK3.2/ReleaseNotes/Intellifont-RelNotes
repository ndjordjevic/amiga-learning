-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

Changes for release 45.2 (2.9.2017)

- Drawer gadgets were rendered incorrectly if the workbench
  had more than 4 colors.

- The font path selection checkbox contained dummy entries,
  confusing programs such as CycleToMenu. Unclear what the
  purpose of this complication actually is.

- Intellifont did not handle alternative font engines very
  well, and it was confused by the presence of Postscript or
  TrueType fonts. This release includes at least a cludge
  for this problem. Keep the "alien" fonts in a separate
  directory (or directories), then multi-assign the
  FONT: assign to include multiple directories. If a
  directory includes a subdirectory named _PSFonts or
  _TTFonts, then the directory is left alone. This avoids
  the conflict, though requires a specific naming convention.

- Refactored the code to ANSI C.

- Replaced the stdlib function with hand-written functions,
  especially stdio functions are replaced with equivalents
  from the dos.library. This shortened the binary
  considerably.
  
Changes for release 45.3 (6.9.2017)

- The ASL requester file hook depended on an uninitialized
  variable and hence never showed any entries.

- The "automatic scan for font resources" kept the dos list
  locked while scanning, did not release any locks in case
  of error, checked for pre-defined DOS types and did not
  make sufficient sanity checks for the DosList. This thing
  was too broken to keep it. Users, please select the
  right directory yourself, and all will be good.

- The help system was broken and would have crashed on an
  RTG screen - and would have rendered a lot of nonsense
  on more than a four-color screen. Removed it for the
  higher good.

- Worked around another potential resource leak in the
  fonts destination scanner - would have not released locks
  in case of errors.

- The directory scanner (mock "dirent.h") was not resource-
  tracked and hence would have leaked locks and deviceprocs
  in case of an error. Added resource tracking for these
  objects, too. Did I say that resource management in
  dumb-o-font, sorry, intellifont is broken?
  
Changes for release 45.4 (7.9.2017)

- Re-did the help function, which is now rtg-correct and
  allocates bitmaps correctly.

- Re-did the automatic scan for font sources and font
  directories, which is now a two-pass (actually, three-
  pass) scan, and now avoids losses (hopefully). Also,
  the type of scanning performed does no longer depend
  on the disk/dos type (why should it?), but all types
  of scans are performed on every disk found.
  
Changes for release 45.5 (1.11.2017)

- Intuition (or rather, gadtools) message handling was
  bizarre. For reasons unknown to me, the "help" key
  was parsed off as part of the "GadgetUp" event, and
  thus could have triggered the help by pure chance.
  Made this now dependent on VANILLAKEY, as it should.
  
Changes for release 45.6 (7.11.2017)

- Made minimum change such that Intellifont shows at
  least the directory it is currently scanning for fonts.
  The choices for font scanning directories are sometimes
  bizarre. It scans all top-level directories of all
  available volumes.
  
Changes for release 45.8 (14.11.2017)

- Intellifont never checked the return code of its ASL
  requesters. Cancel buttons are overrated anyhow...

- Forgot to restore the window title after a font scan,
  fixed.
  
Changes for release 45.9 (17.12.2017)

- Intellifont also recursively scans now the contents of
  every directory named "Fonts" in the available source
  media inserted in the system.

- Fonts already installed and available in one of the
  sources are no longer added to the source list.

- Intellifont uses now the system-wide default wait cursor
  and no longer its own.

- A couple of optimizations for lists that are now
  initialized in the startup code.
  
Changes for release 45.10 (4.3.2018)

- Intellifont did not set the CurrentDir correctly when
  attempting to locate its icon, and hence failed parsing
  its tooltypes.

- Intellifont did not check the tooltypes for NULL, hence
  potentially creating a "Hit".

- Added a new ToolType/Command line argument "NODISKSCAN"
  to disable the initial automatic disk scan.

- Replaced the SAS/C setjmp function by our own function
  that is more compact.

Changes for release 45.11 (16.5.2018)

- Memory allocation was four bytes too large, and these
  four bytes were forgotten to be released later.

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

Changes for release 45.12 (3.9.2019):

- In case the font path is too long, it is now abbreviated
  for the checkbox gadget.

- In case a directory is selected that is not part of the
  fonts path, Intellifont complains now.

Changes for release 47.1 (6.9.2019):

- Made intellifont localizable now.

- Added again the possibility to install fonts outside of
  FONTS:

Changes for release 47.2 (18.9.2019):

- Now all file systems are scanned for font sources, not
  only those associated with an exec device.
  
Changes for release 47.3 (29.9.2019):

- The catalog file is now located in LOCALE:sys, not LOCALE:

Changes for release 47.4 (30.9.2019):

- Intellifont uses now the glyph image to render the drawer
  requester button instead of its hand-rolled image.

- Intellifont is now font sensitive and scalable.

Changes for release 47.5 (3.10.2019):

- Intellifont received now an iconification gadget, similar to
  all other system tools.

Changes for release 47.6 (23.10.2019):

- The POPDRAWER glyph's position and dimensions have been fine 
  tuned for a cleaner look.

Changes for release 47.7 (29.11.2019):

- The DiskfontBase was never defined, and thus the compiler
  generated useless code.

Changes for release 47.8 (14.12.2019):

- The icon position is now reset to defaults before using it
  as AppIcon.

Changes for release 47.9 (30.12.2019):

- If, for some reason, the program got started from CLI but has
  no CLI name, the task name is used as AppIcon title.

Changes for release 47.10 (24.5.2020)

- Replaced the locale string lookup code with a safer version which
  does not go off the rails if asked to look up a string ID value
  which is not stored in the local CatCompBlock data lump.

Changes for release 47.11 (08.08.2020)

- The automatic font scan at startup could take ages on machines 
  with large, many or network drives; it was no longer up-to-date.
  Thus, it has been replaced by a "Scan All Drives"-button which 
  will perform the same action, but will also warn the user about 
  possible delays via requester.

- Removed both the NOAUTOMATICSCAN tooltype and shell argument 
  since they are no longer necessary

- Removed superfluous default string table from the build.

- Updated help text for Outline Font Source with a description of
  the Scan All Drives button.
