-------------------- AmigaOS 3.5/3.9 project -------------------------

Mounter 44.1 (19.4.99)

- Bumped to V44.

Mounter 44.2 (9.6.99)

- Updated the catalog descriptor text.

- Finally wrote some sort of documentation.

Mounter 44.3 (22.6.99)

- Added the NOREMOUNT option and also updated
  the documentation.

Mounter 44.4 (29.8.99)

- LSEG blocks in RDBs did not load properly. In the first place,
  the data didn't get loaded at all. Fixing that wouldn't have helped
  much since the ReadFunc() call, as passed to the function table
  used by InternalLoadSeg(), was following the dos.library documentation
  and would consequently use the wrong registers. I fixed both. Dammit!

Mounter 44.5 (5.9.99)

- Media size calculation didn't work well for some devices. I implanted
  the calculation code Workbench uses, which should solve the problem.

Mounter 44.6 (23.9.99)

- Joanne Dow suggested that in order to query the size of a device, the
  "Read capacity" command should be used instead of the "Mode sense"
  command. That's what Mounter does now.

------------------------ AmigaOS 4 project --------------------------- 

Mounter 44.7 (7.4.2004)

- Updated to build with current header files.

- No longer uses SAS/C small data model.

- Partition and disk size calculations now use 64 bit math.

- Partition size calculation now also takes the number of
  sectors per block into account.

Mounter 51.5 (26.1.2006)

- When trying to remount a partition, Mounter now checks if the
  last active partition, which is now being remounted, will let
  go of the volume.

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

Mounter 47.1 (28.08.2019)

- OS3 backport (based on 51.5)

- Added preliminary GNUmakefile

- Added some #ifdef / #define glue to compile Mounter with SAS/C

Mounter 47.2 (03.10.2019)

- Mounter now requires dos.library V37+

Mounter 47.3 (11.10.2019)

- Mounter supports now LUNs

- Added an iconification gadget for consistency.

Mounter 47.4 (13.10.2019)

- Added a fall-back to topaz.8 in case the window width
  would grow too wide or too tall.

- Shortened some parts of the listview.

Mounter 47.5 (19.10.2019)

- Due to a missing directory change, the mounter did not find
  its icon and hence missed its tool types.

Mounter 47.6 (21.10.2019)

- The scsi information string was formatted incorrectly and hence
  did not fit the headline.

- There was an off-by-one error in the formatting of the partition
  name.

Mounter 47.7 (22.10.2019)

- In case the creation of the CxBroker failed, the window title is
  now adjusted and the Hide button is removed as there is no way
  through commodities to show the window again.

- The program name is now taken from the command line or icon name.

Mounter 47.8 (13.11.2019)

- The volume size output might have resulted in very strange numbers
  such as "0G" as it failed to show fractional units for small volumes.
  This has been fixed.
  
Mounter 47.9 (14.12.2019)

- The AppIcon position is now reset before its used.

Mounter 47.10 (30.12.2019)

- If, for some reason, the program is started from CLI, but the
  CLI name is empty, the task name is used as AppIcon title
  instead.

Mounter 47.11 (23.5.2020)

- Replaced the GetString() lookup function for the ID/string block data
  which would fail if the ID to be looked up was not found.
