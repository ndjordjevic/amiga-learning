MountInfo 47.1 (10.4.2020)

- Backport of MountInfo 51.4

MountInfo 47.2 (2.8.2020)

- Better handling of GlobVec=0 and its consequences in debug mode
  and when building mount files.

- Better handling of DeviceNode.dn_Startup value, which now checks
  if it contains a small integer rather than what could be a valid
  BCPL pointer.
