-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

- Recompiled with SAS/C

- Fixed a couple of missing initializers

Changes for 45.2 (4.3.2018)

- Drawing of the world map was unnecessarily
  complicated and put needless stress on
  RTG systems. Simplified.

---------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project ---------------------------

Changes for 47.1 (01.06.2019):

- Made the GUI scalable.

- Map drawing clips now on the right edge.

Changes for 47.2 (08.06.2019):

- The program uses now the default tool icon for iconification
  if it cannot find its own icon.

- In case the font is smaller than 8x8, the GUI falls back to
  topaz.8.

- Fixed a bug in the startup code that could have caused crashes.

Changes for 47.3 (15.06.2019):

- Recompiled with a new data architecture.

- Locale prefs were not pure, even though they claimed to be so.
  This version now makes a copy of the image bitmaps.
  
Changes for 47.4 (11.07.2019)

- Reworked the code and made gui scale with narrow 6 & 7 pixel wide 
  fonts

Changes for 47.5 (19.01.2020)

- Added support for the new V47+ help system. The common PrefsEd 
  code will now scan HELP:<mylocale>/sys/Prefs/<PrefsEdName>.guide 
  for an AmigaGuide document which offers a documentation of the 
  respective Preference editor. 
  If unsuccessful, it'll search for a fallback in HELP:english/sys/.

- Replaced all custom string functions with UtilityLib's
  SNPrintf()/Strncpy() et al.
