-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

Changes for 45.1 (29.5.2017)

- This is a re-implementation of the aux-handler in C
  with a couple of fixes and additional features.

- Similar to SER: (Port-Handler), serial protocol
  information such as the baud rate and the number of
  stop bits can be given as part of the file name.

- ACTION_WAIT_FOR_CHAR did not pile up, the handler
  could only handle a single packet of this type at
  a time.

Changes for 45.3 (3.6.2017)

- ^C to ^F handling did not properly check whether the
  target port is actually still existing. This release
  implements a check similar to CON:.

Changes for 45.4 (16.6.2017)

- The startup code can now handle both BCPL and C
  type of startup. Hence, "GlobVec = 1" is not
  strictly necessary any more and the new aux
  handler can be used as drop-in replacement for the
  legacy BCPL version.

- The previous version did only transpond the line feed
  into a LF/CR pair if the LF was found at the end of
  the line, and hence line-buffering was enabled for
  the file handle. This is no longer the case.
  
---------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project ---------------------------  
  
Changes for 47.1 (26.12.2018):

- The old aux-handler code is now completely gone and
  replaced by a small stub function that just forwards the
  request to the con-handler. This avoids code duplication,
  as the con-handler became smart enough to also operate
  over a device different than the console.device. Actually,
  previous versions also kind-of supported this opration,
  though starting up the con-handler correctly was kind of
  tricky.

Changes for 47.2 (12.5.2019):

- Since the con-handler is not necessarily a resident module
  anymore, the aux-handler uses now the con-segment from the
  dos.library resident list where it is always put.
