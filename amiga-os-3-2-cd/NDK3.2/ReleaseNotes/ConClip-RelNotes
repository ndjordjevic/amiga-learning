------------------------ AmigaOS 3.2 project -------------------------

Changes for release 47.1 (24.2.2019):

- Added support for obtaining a disk object icon
  for iconification support of the console. The
  console iconification gadget comes from
  ENV:sys/dev_shell.info, SYS:Shell.info,
  SYS:System/Shell.info or SYS:System/CLI.info,
  in this order.
  
Changes for release 47.2 (2.3.2019):

- Adding and removing AppIcons from the workbench
  is now the job of ConClip such that a user
  implementation can in principle replace Icon
  creation by some custom action.

- ConClip OFF did not release all resources and
  did not terminate the side-task that performs
  the event handling.

Changes for release 47.3 (27.11.2019):

- Added support for AppWindows in ConClip.

Changes for release 47.4 (30.11.2019):

- The AppWindow now also allows dropping
  multiple icons simultaneously into a
  console window.

Changes for release 47.5 (14.12.2019):

- The icon position is now reset before its used as
  AppIcon for the shell.
