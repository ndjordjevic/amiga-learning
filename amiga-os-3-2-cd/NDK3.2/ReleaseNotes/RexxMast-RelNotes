----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

Changes for release 47.1 (28.6.2019):

- Changed the window specifications,
  uses now an AUTO/CLOSE/WAIT window.

- Some minor modifications.

Changes for release 47.2 (28.6.2019):

- Some LVOs were missing, thus causing
  RexxMast to crash. The corresponding
  private includes are no longer part
  of the SDK and were hence not available
  for the program anymore.
