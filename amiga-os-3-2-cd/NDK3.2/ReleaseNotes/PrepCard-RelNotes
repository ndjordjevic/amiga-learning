-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

Changes for release 45.1 (12.8.2018)

- Recompiled with SAS/C with register
  argument passing.

- Fixed a race condition on the creation of
  ports of child and parent process which was
  not properly secured with Forbid(). The new
  code uses an entirely different mechanism
  avoiding the problem.

- Fixed another race condition when shutting
  the child down. The main task could have
  terminated before the actually had the chance
  to finish its work, thus crashing the system.

- The program could overrun its output buffers
  when printing strings because buffers were
  not long enough, and there was no check whether
  the output string would actually fit into
  the buffer.

- Changed locale handling to the new direct
  inclusion of the catcomp output.
  
----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------
  
Changes for release 45.2 (9.3.2019):

- In case the card device checker found a
  tuple that only indicates that I/O space
  should be reserved, PrepCard no longer shows
  the card as corrupt. Instead, it is now
  displayed as I/O device, but the Prep-buttons
  remain disabled.

Changes for release 47.1 (29.6.2019):

- Made the GUI scalable.

Changes for release 47.2 (01.7.2019):

- Improved GUI scaling layout.

Changes for release 47.3 (20.7.2019):

- There is no longer a fallback to topaz.8 in case the font is too
  small.

Changes for release 47.4 (26.01.2020):

- Allowed to downscale the gui a bit with smaller fonts

Changes for release (24.5.2020)

- Replaced the locale string lookup code with a safer version which
  does not go off the rails if asked to look up a string ID value
  which is not stored in the local CatCompBlock data lump.
