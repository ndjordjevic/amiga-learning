-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4(.1) project -----------------------

Changes for release 45.1 (26.5.2018):

- Updated to the new locale inclusion mechanism.

- Uses now a minimalistic startup code.

- Recompiled with SAS/C.

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project -------------------------- 

Changes for release 47.1 (15.6.2019):

- Recompiled with new startup code.

Changes for release 47.2 (4.6.2020):

- Moved the CloseAmigaGuide stuff out of DisposeWindow() to avoid
  blowing up AmigaGuide when hiding the application window.

- Replaced accesses to SysBase->ThisTask with FindTask(NULL)

- Changed major version in GNUMakefile to 47 to keep make version 
  happy

Changes for release 47.3 (11.6.2020):

- The signal mask was set up outside the main loop hence it would
  ignore signals from the IDCMP port if the Commodity was started
  with CX_POPUP=NO and the window openend later. (Fixes bug #1595)

Changes for release 47.4 (7.7.2020):

- new commandline/tooltype option "KEEPSTRINGS" not to automatically
  steal focus from a window with an active string gadget

Changes for release 47.5 (31.8.2020):

- AmigaGuide stuff is now initialized/disposed when the window is 
  being created or closed (moved code to CreateWindow() / back to 
  DisposeWindow())

Changes for release 47.6 (9.9.2020):

- Some additional considerations to augment "KEEPSTRINGS". When the 
  active window had an active string gadget and the mouse didn't move, 
  then don't steal focus, either.

Changes for release 47.7 (15.10.2020):
- Moved autopoint-specfic icon tool type and commandline argument 
  processing out of ce_main code for easier maintenance of common 
  ce_main codebase
- added additional logic to window switching considerations in order to
  improve keyboard nagivation, i.e. don't steal a window's focus when
  the mouse didn't move for some time

Changes for release 47.8 (1.2.2021):
- this version will now auto-activate windows when changing screens 
  by keyboard while the mouse is left untouched
