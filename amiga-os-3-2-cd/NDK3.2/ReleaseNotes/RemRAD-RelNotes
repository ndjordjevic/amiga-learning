----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

Changes for release 45.1 (12.4.2019)

- Recompiled with SAS/C, no functional changes.

- Instead of testing the file system startup message
  against a fixed constant, TypeOfMem() is now used to
  validate the pointer (somewhat).

- FindNode(..,"ramdrive.device") is now protected with a
  Forbid/Permit pair to avoid race conditions.

- In case RAD: is busy and cannot be locked, remrad forgot
  to release a test-lock, thus wasting memory and making it
  impossible to remove RAD at any later point.

Changes for release 45.2 (21.4.2019):

- Error messages are now printed over pr_CES.

Changes for release 47.1 (28.11.2019)

- Bumped to v47.
