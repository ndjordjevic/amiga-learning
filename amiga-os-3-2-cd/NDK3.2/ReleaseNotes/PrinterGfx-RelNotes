Changes for 47.1 (18.5.2019):

Changes for 47.2 (8.6.2019):

- The program uses now the default tool icon for iconification
  if it cannot find its own icon.

  topaz.8.

  respective Preference editor. 
  If unsuccessful, it'll search for a fallback in HELP:english/sys/.

- Rebuilt with the small data model. And this time it's serious.
