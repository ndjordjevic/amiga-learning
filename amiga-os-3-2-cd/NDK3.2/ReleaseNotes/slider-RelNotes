------------------------ AmigaOS 4 project ---------------------------

slider.gadget 50.1 (29.06.2002) 

- initial release for OS4.

slider.gadget 50.2 (22.9.2002)

- now supports the new "realistic shading" features of Intuition for
  hicolor and truecolor screens.

- improved support for the "flat" Intuition frame style.

slider.gadget 50.3 (4.10.2002)

- fixed a bug which could make the gadget install an invalid backfill
  hook if its parent layout used a fill pattern.

slider.gadget 50.4 (27.11.2002)

- fixed a bug which caused the gadget's background to be incorrectly
  redrawn on a window refresh event, with simple refresh windows.

slider.gadget 50.5 (15.12.2002) 

- Activating the gadget causes a notification to be send when
  GA_Immediate is set <Thorsten Hansen>.

slider.gadget 50.6 (25.03.2003) 

- When changing SLIDER_DispHook the hook function is called
  when the current slider values. Had to introduce
  SLIDER_InitDispHook (BOOL) for this because some
  programs, namely the new prefs framework, doesn't like it.
  Sigh!

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

slider.gadget 50.7 (18.8.2019) 

- Notice that v50.7 reflects only a transitional status between the 
  OS4 and 3.2 projects.
  
- Fixed race condition when opening/closing.

- Now runs on 68000/68010.

slider.gadget 47.1 (1.9.2019):

- recompiled with data=far and utllib to improve
  the code generation.

slider.gadget 47.2 (2.9.2019):

- Fixed a compiler problem, __SAVEDS was used
  with DATA=FARONLY, which confused the compiler
  a lot.

slider.gadget 47.3 (13.12.2019)

- Corrected a small inaccuracy in the rendering of the slider body.

- Added optional notification of changes in gadget's disable state.

- Now the gadget is able to automatically display its current level
  with optional pre-processing and formatting of the level string,
  just like GadTools' SLIDER_KIND gadgets (i.e. without needing an
  external display object acting as a target for notification).
  Note: this NEEDS bevel.image 47.2 or higher to work reliably.

- Added a workaround to make sure that enough space is reserved for
  the level display, even when using fonts where the numeric (0..9)
  glyphs don't all have the exact same horizontal size.

- The gadget does now support the GA_ActivateKey attribute.

- The gadget does now support tab-cycling.

- The gadget does now react reliably to every mouse click done on the
  container; previously it could miss some clicks every now and then.

- The "auto-repeat" of the knob movement does now start after a short
  delay (when clicking on the container), rather than immediately.

- The gadget is now functionally equivalent to AOS4 version 51.4 (at
  least if I haven't forgotten something). This is as far as we can
  go without further extending Intuition and other classes first.

- The gadget's autodoc is now embedded in the sources.

- Removed a number of compiler and optimizer warnings.

- Performed some needed code housekeeping.

slider.gadget 47.4 (3.4.2021)

- Make the slider handle a bit smaller

slider.gadget 47.5 (3.4.2021)

- fix rendering of disabled pattern - as good as it can get without knowing bevel thicknesses
