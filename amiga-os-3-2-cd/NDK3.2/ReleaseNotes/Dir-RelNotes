-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

Changes made for release 45.2 (26.5.2017)

- The DIR command now indicates softlinks
  on its output.

Changes made for release 45.3 (4.10.2017)

- The DIR command used a two-column layout for
  regular files, without ever checking the maximum
  file size, nor the console size. This release
  of DIR is much more dynamic and adjusts its output
  to the size of the console and the file names it
  finds.

Changes made for release 45.4 (4.10.2017)

- Forgot to switch the console mode. Not every console
  is as forgiving as ViNCEd.

Changes made for release 45.5 (7.10.2017)

- The Dir command no longer prints trailing blanks at
  the last column of the output, avoiding line feeds
  for very long outputs.
  
- In case the standard output is not interactive, Dir
  gets now the console width directly from the current
  console '*' such that piping the output to "more" is
  possible.

Changes made for release 45.7 (7.10.2017)

- Dir now obtains the console size only once in the
  beginning to avoid interactions with pagers.

Changes made for release 45.8 (7.10.2017)

- Dir does now no longer confuse softlinks with
  directories.

- Streamlined the console dimension request a bit.

- Streamlined the output formatting somewhat.

Changes made for release 45.9 (19.10.2017)

- The hard and softlink indicators where placed at
  the wrong location, resulting in bad formatting.
  
Changes made for release 45.10 (5.3.2018)

- Dir reserves now one additional space for separating
  columns.

Changes made for release 45.11 (26.3.2018)

- Due to a real freak accident in the CON: handler, an
  AUTO window receiving DIR as first command was opened
  as RAW handler and for that reason never turned the
  Close raw event on, so the window could not be closed.

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

Changes made for release 45.12 (21.4.2019):

- Prints now errors over pr_CES.

Changes for release 47.1 (28.11.2019)
- Bumped to v47.

Changes for release 47.2 (19.12.2019)

- In case the target object to be examined is exclusively
  locked, Dir locks now the parent directory and examines
  the object from there.
