-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4(.1) project -----------------------

Changes for release 45.1 (14.7.2018)

- Recompiled from 44.20 for 3.1.4.

Changes for release 45.2 (14.8.2018)

- A couple of minor optimizations.

- Fixed a race condition in library
  handling.

Changes for release 45.3 (8.9.2018)

- The "creative" inter-process communication between
  the data types client and the sound daemon required
  to disable some optimizations. With a properly placed
  "volatile", the compiler can be made happy and requested
  to re-read the necessary pointers.

- Removed a lot of code duplications and simplified the code
  considerably.

- The check whether the audio samples were in chip memory
  were testing for MEMF_FAST instead, and hence may have
  failed for memory that is neither CHIP nor FAST. There
  is probably no such thing, but better be safe than sorry.

Changes for release 45.4 (10.9.2018)

- Fixed another race condition in LibOpen.

Changes for release 45.5 (18.9.2018)

- One of the IORequests was assigned to the wrong channel.

- If now one of the IORequests returns, both are aborted
  to avoid the risk of a potential deadlock.

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

Changes for release 47.1 (25.5.2020): 

- Added SDTA_BitsPerSample tag.

Changes for release 47.2 (26.7.2020):

- Fix seamless playback of streaming audio.

- Removed some code duplication

Changes for release 47.3 (27.7.2020):

- Fix seamless playback of streaming stereo.

- Send mono sounds to both left and right

Changes for release 47.4 (09.sep.2020):

- Improvements for seamless playback

Changes for release 47.5 (26.9.2020):

- Fixed corrupt saving of 16- and 32-bit samples.

Changes for release 47.6 (14.11.2020):

- Fix restarting after running on empty. Now we no longer restarts immidiately
  As that would just cause us to keep running into empty over and over again.
  Instead we halve the empty sample length so we may have to play empty twice
  but possibly we can get running again faster.
