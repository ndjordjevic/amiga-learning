------------------------ AmigaOS 4 project ---------------------------

scroller.gadget 46.1 (21.02.2002)

- initial release for OS4.

scroller.gadget 50.1 (30.6.2002)

- bumped the version number to 50.

scroller.gadget 50.2 - 50.46

- internal development versions, never released.

scroller.gadget 50.47 (18.8.2002)

- first release for testing, with support for some Intuition V50 
  features.

scroller.gadget 50.48 (27.9.2002)

- now propagates the backfill to its button objects.

scroller.gadget 50.49 (16.11.2002)

- now directly calls Intuition (when running under V50) to draw the
  scroller's background. This means that the "Furrow" background type
  is finally working.

scroller.gadget 50.50 (12.1.2003)

- under V50, in some circumstances the gadget could fail to correctly 
  set the type of its container image, which later caused it to 
  miscalculate its own size; now fixed.

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

scroller.gadget 50.51 (18.8.2019)

- Notice that v50.51 reflects only a transitional status between the 
  OS4 and 3.2 projects.
  
- fixed a race condition when opening/closing.

- now runs on 68000/68010.

scroller.gadget 47.1 (1.9.2019):

- recompiled with data=far and utllib to improve
  the code generation.

scroller.gadget 47.2 (2.9.2019):

- Fixed a compiler problem, __SAVEDS was used
  with DATA=FARONLY, which confused the compiler
  a lot.

scroller.gadget 47.3 (19.9.2019):

- Fixed: dots were being drawn on knob even if there was no room for 
  them.

scroller.gadget 47.4 (19.9.2019):

- Now container is drawn using 3D look instead of flat look.

scroller.gadget 47.5 (28.11.2019)

- Fixed a bug where SCROLLER_Visible would be changed if it was larger 
  than SCROLLER_Total

scroller.gadget 47.6 (26.12.2019)

- Fixed that horizontal scrollers are way too large

scroller.gadget 47.7 (26.12.2019)

- Fixed that horizontal scrollers internal layout a bit, now that the 
  bevels are reported correctly

scroller.gadget 47.8 (17.01.2020)

- Scroller size now depend on screen font with a few tweaks

- Minimum size of knob is decreased a bit, to make it easier to see 
  proportion to total, but not too small

scroller.gadget 47.9 (17.02.2020)

- Make it work better with values above 65535

scroller.gadget 47.10 (5.03.2020)

- Fix a guru with DAPlayer related to the latest changes. Could 
  possibly have affected all users

- Fix asking for bevel thickness was done with wrong bevel style

- Fix an offset by 1 bug when clicking near the knob

- Fix the size of the arrowbuttons

- Limit the default size for font sizes larger than 16 (above it only 
  grows by 50% of font size)

scroller.gadget 47.11 (2.may.2020)

- Extensive refactor of the Top, Vis Total math. Removed the middle 
  stage completely, cleaned up the spaghetti it had become over the 
  years. Renamed a lot of internal variables for more clarity

scroller.gadget 47.12 (6.may.2020)

- Fine tuning after the refactor

scroller.gadget 47.13 (15.may.2020)

- Implement the new GM_HANDLESCROLL

scroller.gadget 47.14 (25.may.2020)

- Make the default size of the scroller smaller, yet still scale with 
  the font size

- Fix a case of  horix/vert mixup

- Some bad layout math removed

- And don't recalculate the bevels all the time

scroller.gadget 47.15 (08.jun.2020)

- use the new GA_Hidden and GA_ParentHidden to determine if we should 
  paint ourself

scroller.gadget 47.16 (16.sep.2020)

- Make the scrollwheel distance per event slightly nicer (3 times 
  delta but no more than quarter page, and no less than 1 delta)

- Introduce bigger minimum size for vertical resolution above 300px

scroller.gadget 47.17 (16.nov.2020)

- The border sizes of the container are now computed more accurately
  (whenever possible) via IM_FRAMEBOX/FRAMEF_MINIMAL, which allows to
  specify a DrawInfo providing better visual context information.

- The amount of overlap between buttons (which depends on the current
  bevel style being XEN or non-XEN) would not be updated on reception
  of a REACTION_ChangePrefs notification; now fixed.

- When the current bevel style is XEN and "3D Scroller" is turned off,
  the container is now actually drawn in XEN style as well for better
  visual consistency (especially in case it is part of a listbrowser).

scroller.gadget 47.18 (23.nov.2020)

- Experimentally changed the look of the container used for XEN style
  also when "3D Scroller" is turned on, again to make it blend better
  with the overall GUI appearance.

- The pixels at the extreme sides of the knob were drawn twice during
  refresh due to an overlap with the background rendering; now fixed.

scroller.gadget 47.19 (22.dec.2020)

- Adjusted the code in order to support the new "highlighted" look of
  selected knobs in all bevel styles when "3D Scroller" is off, while
  preserving their usual visual feedback when the same option is on.

- When clicking on a knob, it now immediately changes to its selected
  appearance. This used to only happen once it started being dragged.

- Scrollers in XEN style are now two pixels wider (or taller, if they
  are horizontal) when "3D Scroller" is turned on; the recent change
  in their container's appearance had made them become way too "thin"
  compared to how scrollers look in all other styles.

- In some cases the size of arrow buttons would not exactly match the
  thickness of a scroller lying on the opposite axis, thus disrupting
  the alignment of a horizontal/vertical scroller pair; now fixed.

- The gadget's GadgetRender field now points to the BOOPSI image used
  for the knob. Also, the traditional "six dots" won't be rendered if
  the knob image's NextImage field is non-NULL. All of this allows an
  application to easily customize a knob's decoration, which may come
  useful e.g. when implementing some simple form of theming.


scroller.gadget 47.20 (4.dmarec.2021)

- Only do something if the mouse has actually moved
