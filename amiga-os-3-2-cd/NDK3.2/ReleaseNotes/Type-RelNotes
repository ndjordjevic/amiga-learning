-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

Changes for release 45.1 (25.10.2018)

- Type can now be run as filter in a pipe.

Changes for release 45.2 (31.03.2019)

- Forgot a pointer indirection in printing an error
  message, causing a MuForce hit if Type could not
  open the source file.

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

Changes for release 45.3 (21.4.2019):

- Error messages are now printed over pr_CES.

Changes for release 47.1 (28.11.2019)

- Bumped to v47.

type 47.2 (29.6.2020)

- Backport from OS4 version, which supports, among other things,
  the AUTO, TEXTONLY, WIDTH and BUFFER options, and also includes
  the full command documentation.

- Unless the HEX or NUM options are used, the input file
  contents will be written unmodified to the output.
  Previously, any NUL byte in the input file would cause
  the output to be truncated.

- Reading from a pipe is now fully integrated, to the degree
  that error output will be redirected to the console window
  rather than accidentally spilling it into the output
  stream.


type 47.3 (7.1.2021)

- Before calling MatchFirst(), the AnchorPath structure passed to
  is always cleared and reinitialized. This is necessary because
  the AnchorPath structure is reused for all the files or directories
  which may need to be copied and the last call to MatchNext() may
  have set flags which are still set when MatchFirst() is called
  again.
