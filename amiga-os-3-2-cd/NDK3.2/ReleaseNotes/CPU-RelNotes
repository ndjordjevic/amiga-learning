-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

CPU release 45.1 (22.7.2017)

    - FASTROM/NOFASTROM/TRAP/NOTRAP are now dummies
      They only worked for the 68030 anyhow, and did not
      go through the mmu.library.
   
    - Added support for the 68060 and many 68060 features
      that are now identified.
   
    - Added tests for CPU errata.
    
CPU release 45.2 (22.7.2017)

    - Fixed wrong 68060 detection.

    - A couple of minor optimizations.
    
CPU release 45.3 (6.1.2018)

    - The error printed if the CPU detection string was wrong
      was just junk because the address of the option (and not
      the contents itself) was printed.

    - For symmetry reasons, a check for the 68000 was added, which
      succeeds always.

CPU release 45.4 (25.1.2018)

    - I was testing with the bit # instead of the bit field for the
      FPU type. Fixed.
      
CPU release 45.5 (23.2.2018)

    - Added a CHECKINSTALL option which tests for the presence of a
      CPU library on affected CPU models.
      
CPU release 45.6 (25.2.2018)

    - CPU did not print a closing bracket after the cache settings
      on the 68020.

CPU release 45.7 (6.5.2018)

    - Added the CPUTYPE,FPUTYPE and MMTYPE switches to print only the
      minimal amount of information for scripting purposes.

    - Added the TO command line switch to redirect the output.
    
CPU release 45.8 (10.5.2018)

    - Removed explicit recommendation for the MuLibs.
    
CPU release 45.9 (13.5.2018)

    - Output of the errata tests was mixed up. This is fixed now.

CPU release 45.10 (21.6.2018)

    - Permuted a bit the output of the FastROM identification.

CPU release 45.11 (9.1.2019)

    - The I4 bug test of the 68060 touched the cache settings
      installed before. It now no longer does.

CPU release 46.1 (13.1.2019):

    - Added a test for the 68060 F6 bug.

CPU release 46.2 (13.1.2019):

    - The I4 bug test of the 68060 touched the cache settings
      installed before. It now no longer does.

    - If the I4 test fails, the output of the F6 test was never
      printed.
 
CPU release 46.3 (21.4.2019):

- Error messages are now printed over pr_CES.
      
CPU release 47.1 (3.9.2019):

- On library installation errors, prints now the request to
  insert the 3.2 disks, not the 3.1.4 disks.
