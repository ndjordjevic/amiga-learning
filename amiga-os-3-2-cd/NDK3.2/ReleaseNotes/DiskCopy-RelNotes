-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

Changes for release 45.2 (4.6.2017)

- Diskcopy now also supports large disks (>4GB) by
  supporting TD64,NSD and direct SCSI transport,
  depending on the mount list settings and device
  capabilities.

- The track buffer uses now the proper memory type,
  namely the combined source and target device
  memory requirements. This might mean that in certain
  cases a copy is not possible.
  
Changes for release 45.3 (8.6.2017)

- The track buffer for source and destination may now
  have differing memory types. In such a case, the
  data is copied over once by the CPU.

- Previous releases did not honour the MaxTransfer
  settings in the mount list. Fixed.
  
Changes for release 45.4 (20.6.2018)

- Diskcopy attempted to use NSD64 even if the device
  does not speak NSD64 at all because the check was
  upside down. Fixed.

Changes for release 45.5 (25.4.2019)

- Fixed a hit when opening the default font.
