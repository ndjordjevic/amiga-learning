------------------------ AmigaOS 4 project ---------------------------

getfile.gadget 46.1 (18.02.02)

- initial release for OS4.

getfile.gadget 50.1 (3.7.2002)

- bumped the version number to 50.

getfile.gadget 50.2 (4.7.2002)

- first release for testing, with support for some Intuition V50 
  features.

getfile.gadget 50.3 (27.9.2002)

- now propagates the backfill to its button object.

getfile.gadget 50.4 (14.2.2003)

- Fixed makefile which did not work with standard build environment
  (V:aug/bin/make).

- No longer searches include files in V:ReAction/include and include/
  but in V:include instead.

- Changed __ASM and _REGXX macros to ASM and REG for future gcc
  compatibility.

- Declared const data as STATIC CONST to remove the data hunk.

- Defined __USE_SYSBASE to forbid the startup code to read ExecBase
  from chip ram.

- Compiled with CPU=68060 which runs on 68020 and up instead of 
  CPU=ANY. The startup code did already exit without an 020.

- BugFix: The default for GETFILE_ReadOnly was not initialized to TRUE
  as documented in the autodocs.

- BugFix: GETFILE_DrawersOnly and GETFILE_DoSaveMode did interfere, 
  e.g. specifying GETFILE_DrawersOnly, TRUE, GETFILE_DoSaveMode, 
  FALSE, ...did result in an ASL file requester that allowed selecting 
  files. Changed the variable that holds the information from one byte 
  with three defined states to two 1-bit-booleans.

getfile.gadget 50.5 (20.02.2003) 

- GETFILE_ReadOnly defaults to FALSE, again.

- GM_DOMAIN always returns the minimum height, now.

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

getfile.gadget 50.6 (18.8.2019)

- Notice that v50.6 reflects only a transitional status between the 
  OS4 and 3.2 projects.
  
- Fixed race condition when opening/closing.

- Now runs on 68000/68010.

getfile.gadget 47.1 (1.9.2019):

- recompiled with data=far and utllib to improve
  the code generation.

getfile.gadget 47.2 (1.10.2019):

- now doesn't read string gadget if it is not being shown.
