------------------------ AmigaOS 4 project ---------------------------

string.gadget 50.1 (30.06.02)

- initial release of OS4.

string.gadget 50.2 (1.7.2002)

- internal development version, never released.

string.gadget 50.3 (3.7.2002)

- first release for testing, with support for some Intuition V50 
  features.

string.gadget 50.4 (14.10.2002)

- no longer calls OpenDiskFont() if not running in the context of a
  process.

string.gadget 50.5 (17.10.2002)

- overhauled library startup code.

string.gadget 50.6 (21.10.2002)

- added a missing __saveds.

- removed the 50.4 change because it was fix for bug that
  the gadget never had ;)

-------------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project -----------------------

string.gadget 50.7 (18.8.2019)

- Notice that v50.7 reflects only a transitional status between the 
  OS4 and 3.2 projects.
  
- fixed race condition when opening/closing.

- now runs on 68000/68010.

string.gadget 47.1 (1.9.2019):

- recompiled with data=far and utllib to improve
  the code generation.

- There was still a race condition in LibOpen.

string.gadget 47.2 (2.9.2019):

- Fixed a compiler problem, __SAVEDS was used
  with DATA=FARONLY, which confused the compiler
  a lot.

string.gadget 47.3 (8.9.2019):

- shortened the code by adding initialization
  code for the BSS segment.
  
string.gadget 47.4 (12.10.2019):

- Removed the requirement to run on a 68020 upwards,
  replaced string functions with compiler built-ins.

string.gadget 47.5 (14.10.2019):

- Fixed an off-by-one error when allocating string
  buffers.

string.gadget 47.6 (19.12.2019):

- Modern cursor control

- Extend selection with shift + mouse click

- Also some code cleanup, but it could need a lot more cleanup

string.gadget 47.7 (21.12.2019):

- Make it possible to get interim updates

- Also react on the modern keyboard keys: home and end

- Unguarded values crash fix, selection restore fix

string.gadget 47.8 (17.01.2020):

- Fix quad click not unselecting text again - now it does

string.gadget 47.9 (18.01.2020):

- Fixed: it was drawing over its bevel.

string.gadget 47.10 (10.3.2020):

- Fixed: ghosting pattern was not covering the left and right sides.

string.gadget 47.11 (19.3.2020):

- Fixed: editing STRINGA_ReplaceMode strings wasn't allowed when
  the string was at its maximum length.

- Shift-Backspace and Shift-Del now delete from the cursor
  position to the start or end, respectively, of the line.

string.gadget 47.12 (29.4.2020):

- Improved algorithm for handling the STRINGA_MinVisible tag.

string.gadget 47.13 (23.6.2020):

- Fixed: minimum width was too narrow when using XEN style.

string.gadget 47.14 (01.jul.2020)
- Fix hit and don't set mousepointer if readonly

string.gadget 47.15 (27.7.2020):

- STRINGA_MinVisible now handles proportional fonts correctly.

string.gadget 47.16 (25.10.2020):

- Fix not being able to insert chars if string was at MaxChars, but text was
  selected so it should've been possible

string.gadget 47.17 (17.11.2020):

- The border sizes of the bevel box are now computed more accurately
  (whenever possible) via IM_FRAMEBOX/FRAMEF_MINIMAL, which allows to
  specify a DrawInfo providing better visual context information.

- The routine calculating the left offset of the displayed text would
  return a random value in case a certain (wrong) combination of bits
  was present in the gadget's Activation flags. Now fixed.

- Implemented the still missing GM_LAYOUT method. Not having it could
  cause the gadget to behave incorrectly when inside a virtual group.

- The determination of which character gets selected by a mouse click
  was off (horizontally) by two pixels. Now fixed.

- Scrolling the text could end up overwriting up to two pixels of the
  left or right edge (depending on the justification) of the gadget's
  bevel box. Now fixed.

string.gadget 47.18 (28.11.2020):

- Fix that setting disabled didn't redraw the gadget

- Place cursor at the nearest position between characters

string.gadget 47.19 (15.02.2021):

- Fix that interim updates were not marked as such
