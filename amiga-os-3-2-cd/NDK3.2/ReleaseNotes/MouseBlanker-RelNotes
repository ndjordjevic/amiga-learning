- Recompiled with new startup code.

Changes for release 47.2 (4.6.2020):

- Moved the CloseAmigaGuide stuff out of DisposeWindow() to avoid
  blowing up AmigaGuide when hiding the application window.

- Replaced accesses to SysBase->ThisTask with FindTask(NULL)

- Changed major version in GNUMakefile to 47 to keep make version 
  happy

Changes for release 47.3(11.6.2020):

- The signal mask was set up outside the main loop hence it would
  ignore signals from the IDCMP port if the Commodity was started
  with CX_POPUP=NO and the window openend later. (Fixes bug #1595)

Changes for release 47.4 (31.8.2020):

- AmigaGuide stuff is now initialized/disposed when the window is 
  being created or closed (moved code to CreateWindow() / back to 
  DisposeWindow())
