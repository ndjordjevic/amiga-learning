------------------------ AmigaOS 4 project ---------------------------

getfont.gadget 46.1 (18.02.02)

- initial release for OS4.

getfont.gadget 50.1 (3.7.2002)

- bumped the version number to 50.

getfont.gadget 50.2 (4.7.2002)

- first release for testing, with support for some Intuition V50 features.

getfont.gadget 50.3 (27.9.2002)

- now propagates the backfill to its button object.

getfont.gadget 51.4 (11.12.2002)

- Fixed makefile which did not work with standard build environment
  (V:aug/bin/make).

- No longer searches include files in V:ReAction/include and include/
  but in V:include instead.

- Changed __ASM and _REGXX macros to ASM and REG for future gcc
  compatibility.

- Compiled with data=far, linked with scnb.lib and without sc.lib, scm.lib
  and small.lib, removed all __SAVEDS macros for future gcc compatibility.

- Declared const data as STATIC CONST to remove the data hunk.

- Defined __USE_SYSBASE to forbid the startup code to read ExecBase
  from chip ram.

- Compiled with CPU=68060 which runs on 68020 and up instead of CPU=ANY.
  The startup code did already exit without an 020.

- Now uses 256 bytes instead of 100 bytes for the font name, no longer
  uses strcpy() without size check for font names.

- Now uses 264 bytes instead of 128 bytes for the fontname/size gadget
  text, no longer uses RawDomt() without size check for this text, no
  longer uses (void (*)())"\x16\xc0\x4e\x75" as PutChProc for RawDoFmt().

- Now passes the TextAttr.ta_Flags as ASLFO_InitialFlags to asl.library.

- Added new tags GETFONT_CharSet, GETFONT_DoCharSet, GETFONT_OTagOnly,
  GETFONT_SampleText, GETFONT_ScalableOnly. Bumped version to 51.
  Now requires asl.library V46+ and diskfont.library V46+.

getfont.gadget 51.5 (11.12.2002)

- BugFix: When setting GETFONT_TextAttr the fontname/size gadget text
  was not updated.

getfont.gadget 51.6 (5.4.2003)

- Fixed possible problem introduced in V51.5: The fontname/size gadget
  text is now updated with DoMethod(), not with SetGadgetAttrs(), from
  within the class dispatcher. Thanks to Stephan Rupprecht for the hint.

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

getfont.gadget 51.7 (18.8.2019)

- Notice that v51.7 reflects only a transitional status between the 
  OS4 and 3.2 projects.
  
- fixed race condition when opening/closing.

- no longer refuses to open under < V46.

- now runs on 68000/68010.

getfont.gadget 47.1 (1.9.2019):

- recompiled with data=far and utllib to improve
  the code generation.
