- Added support for off-screen window dragging setting

Changes for 47.1 (18.5.2019):

- Made the GUI scalable.

Changes for 47.3 (15.6.2019):

- Recompiled with a new data architecture.

Changes for 47.4 (17.9.2019):

- The default value of the off-screen window dragging did not
  reflect its true default value, which is unfortunately "off".

Changes for 47.5 (19.1.2020):

- Added support for the new V47+ help system. The common PrefsEd 
  code will now scan HELP:<mylocale>/sys/Prefs/<PrefsEdName>.guide 
  for an AmigaGuide document which offers a documentation of the 
  respective Preference editor. 
  If unsuccessful, it'll search for a fallback in HELP:english/sys/.

- Added options to control "hover of gadgets", and "mouse pointer 
  reflects"

  new windows

- No longer warns the user multiple times about window resizers when 
  eg. using the "Save" button.

- ALSO make sure icontrol pref files are safe to use on any 
  combination of iprefs and intuition

- Make the "mouse pointer reflects" combobox a bit wider to fit more 
  translations

Changes for 47.10 (19.05.2020)

- Rebuilt with the small data model. And this time it's serious.

Changes for 47.11 (01.06.2020)

- Added support for Intuition's new window border aspect ratio
  correction feature. Requires intuition.library 47.28 or higher.

Changes for 47.12 (04.06.2020)

- restuctured the layout quite a bit as it was too tall for ntsc and 
  strings were not clear enough.

Changes for 47.13 (20.06.2020)

- prepared a subwindow for advanced acaling options.

Changes for 47.14 (15.07.2020)

- a bit more restructure of the dialog layout to give more space for 
  strings

Changes for 47.15 (07.08.2020)

- The order of the checkboxes had been changed without updating the 
  index of a gadget in the gadget list

Changes for 47.16 (13.09.2020)

- Make some buttons a little wider to allow more space for 
  translations

Changes for 47.17 (25.10.2020)

- Enabled the "Advanced Scaling Options" button and renamed it to
  "Appearance Settings...". It can now be used to open a separate
  window grouping all options related to GUI appearance, plus an
  exception list allowing to force non-size-adaptive applications
  to ignore the global settings when required for compatibility.

- Removed the aspect ratio cycle gadget from the main window and
  moved it to the Appearance Settings window.

- In addition to the old aspect ratio options, the new appearance
  settings offer a set of automatic border gadget scaling options
  (percentages of window title bar height, with 1:1 aspect ratio),
  and the ability to increase the default screen and window title
  bar height with a choice of increments ranging from 0 to 16.

- The GUI exception list in the Appearance Settings window allows
  to add program or screen names (supporting wildcard characters
  for pattern matching), for each of which the user can enable or
  disable a number of compatibility options.
  
- The preferences file (IControl.prefs) written by the editor now
  contains an IEXC chunk for every item in the exception list (if
  any exists). These chunks will be read and parsed by the latest
  version of IPrefs in order to update its internal GUI exception
  database. Older versions of IPrefs (and Intuition) will simply
  ignore this extra information.

Changes for 47.18 (03.11.2020)

- Rearrange the gui elements for border corrections. And change a
  lot of the strings to improve instant understanding (though it
  is a difficult subject and reading the manual is still suggested)

Changes for 47.19 (06.12.2020)

- Fixed a bug which would cause a hit when closing appearance 
  settings' subwindow.
- Moved all settings for managing compatibility exceptions of
  specific apps to yet another subwindow
- Repositioned some checkmarks of main window to render it more 
  pleasing to the eye.
- Added frames to the subwindows' GUI.

Changes for 47.20 (11.12.2020)

- Modified Listview scrollers' width to match other OS
  applications'.

Changes for 47.21 (2.1.2021)

- Now uses GTMX_ScaledSpacing for the radio buttons.

Changes for 47.22 (24.3.2021)

- Fix for bug #2003. No longer crashes if gadtools.library cannot be opened.
