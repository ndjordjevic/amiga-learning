-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

New for 45.1 (23.12.2016)

- Fixed a wrong allocation of a dummy IORequest in init.asm which
should be an IOStdReq instead.

- Added the 48bit LBA ATA commands to the state machine in attask.asm.

New for 45.2 (8.7.2017)

- scsi commands with non-zero LUNs create now errors.

New for 45.3 (29.11.2017)

- Fixed the transmission for more than 255 blocks in a go, making
  MAXTRANSFER hopefully obsolete.

- Added support for TD_READ64,TD_WRITE64,TD_SEEK64 and TD_FORMAT64
  giving the device the full command set.

- Optimized a couple of branches.

New for 45.4 (18.12.2017)

- Apparently, TD64 commands were still not yet active. Should be
  now.
  
- Added more robust identification of devices, especially
  SCSI_INQUIRY should now return the correct drive type (random access)
  for compact flash and atapi devices.

New for 45.5 (12.5.2018)

- The reformat function did not pass a potential error code over
  to the error handler, and hence reported no or nonsensical error
  codes in case of failure.

New for 45.6 (15.5.2018)

- In case the memory allocation for the private data structures of
  the SCSITask failed, the code runs now into a deadend Alert()
  instead of crashing.

New for 45.7 (16.5.2018)

- Found more memory allocations that must not fail, and added an
  Alert() for it.

------------------------ AmigaOS 3.2 project -------------------------

New for 45.8 (8.5.2019):

- A transfer across a 4GB boundary with more than 255 blocks involved
  would erroneously trigger an error. This has been fixed.
  Thanks to Toni Willen for the bug report.

New for 45.9 (27.7.2019):

- Another bug on large SCSI transfers has been fixed where the 
  high-byte of the transfer size was not cleared correctly. This would 
  have affected direct SCSI transfers.

New for 47.1 (3.8.2019):

- Large TD_SEEKs (TD_SEEK64 and NSDCMD_SEEK64) were not handled
  correctly and did not use the proper SCSI command, namely SEEK(10).
  Instead, the iotask initiated a write request (shudder).
- Bumped to 47.1 to fit to the new ROM revision.

New for 47.2 (17.9.2019):
- Replaced the manual gayle detection test in attask.asm to a call into
  exec/ReadGayle(). Note, however, that this is a bit experimental.

New for 47.3: (27.12.2019)

- TD_REMCHANGEINT was, despite all claims, not safe yet
  as it might have happened that the corresponding
  TD_ADDCHANGEINT was not yet processed (still pending),
  and in such a case, it would remove just some request
  from the request queue.

New for 47.4: (30.12.2019)

- Backported some changes from Os 4.x scsi.device.
