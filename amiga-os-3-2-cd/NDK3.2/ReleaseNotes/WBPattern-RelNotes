-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

Changes for 45.1 (18.2.2018)

- Recompiled with SAS/C

- Fixed a couple of missing initializers

Changes for 45.2 (2.4.2018)

- Reduced window width by two pixels so it'll fit highres autoscroll 
  screens

- Added controls for background dither and color matching quality

- Reworked some locale strings

- Cleaned up interface

- Revision was way off

Changes for 45.3 (28.4.2018)

- Fixed the ghosting pattern of the editor such that it fits exactly 
  to the size of the area that is overwritten by the magnified pattern. 
  This avoid left-over pixels in the editor

Changes for 45.4 (29.4.2018)

- Reduced window's height for the sake of NTSC HighRes

- Cleaned up frame code, saving ~500 bytes

Changes for 45.5 (2.5.2018)

- Fixed the size of the magnifier frame again, it is one pixel distance
  on each side, not two.

- Retired stubs.asm. SAS/C got smart enough not to hickup on the huge
  argument list of graphics calls.

Changes for 45.6 (7.8.2018)

- A lot of forgotten WaitBlit()s all over the place. Bitmaps were used
  before they were cleared completely, and released before the blitter
  was done. Yuck.

- The code was directly peeking Screen->BitMap.Depth, which is known
  to go wrong for RTG screens. Changed this to GetBitMapAttr(), and
  limited the screen depth to 8.

- When loading ILBM graphics from the clipboard or file, the code
  also specified the target screen it is running on. While in principle
  a good idea, this also instructed the picture.datatype to potentially
  allocate an RTG bitmap which the code is unable to handle... Yuck!
  Hence, the picture datatype now only gets the colors, and then 
  creates a native bitmap.

- The number of palette entries for the pattern is now taken from the
  screen and not limited by 8.

- When saving patterns, only the present bitplanes are saved, and not
  any other junk that was left behind in memory by chance.

Changes for 45.7 (10.8.2018)

- The size of the sparse color table for rendering any incoming bitmap
  on Paste or Load was still computed incorrectly.

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

Changes for 47.1 (30.5.2019):

- Made the GUI scalable.

Changes for 47.2 (8.6.2019):

- Fixed the logic for triggering refreshes. Drawing into the gadget
  no longer clears the activity flag, but refreshing does.

- The program uses now the default tool icon for iconification
  if it cannot find its own icon.

- In case the font is smaller than 8x8, the GUI falls back to
  topaz.8.

- Fixed a bug in the startup code that could have caused crashes.

Changes for 47.3 (16.06.2019):

- Recompiled with a new data architecture.

Changes for 47.4 (5.7.2019):

- Added support for the new prefs item to customize the layout of the
  background picture.

Changes for 47.5 (8.7.2019):

- The layout gadget is now disabled for all but the workbench 
  background gadget.

- Since we have some extra space now, resized the window to better fit 
  640x200 with topaz/8

Changes for 47.6 (8.9.2019):

- Small string fix

Changes for 47.7 (19.1.2020):

- Added support for the new V47+ help system. The common PrefsEd 
  code will now scan HELP:<mylocale>/sys/Prefs/<PrefsEdName>.guide 
  for an AmigaGuide document which offers a documentation of the 
  respective Preference editor. 
  If unsuccessful, it'll search for a fallback in HELP:english/sys/.

- Replaced most custom string functions with UtilityLib's
  SNPrintf()/Strncpy() et al.

- Some cleanups.

Changes for 47.8 (13.5.2020):

- Now allows to select picture parameters (such as color precision and
  dithering quality) individually for each backdrop type. They used to
  be configurable only for the Workbench backdrop, which prevented the
  user from choosing the lowest color precision for Windows and Screen
  backdrop pictures (in order e.g. to spare pens for icon remapping).
  This feature was still missing in comparison to the OS 3.9 WBPattern.

- Now allows to select the layout also for Windows and Screen backdrop
  pictures (except for centering). IPrefs already supports this, so we
  could as well enable it here, too; it can have its uses. Plus, it is
  an unique feature that's actually not available in OS 3.9.

Changes for 47.9 (19.5.2020)

- Rebuilt with the small data model. And this time it's serious.

- Removed the unused assembly language and header files.

Changes for 47.10 (05.09.2020)

- Added smart refresh to fix file requester move crash

Changes for 47.11 (07.09.2020)

- Reverted smart refresh back to simple refresh. Crashed fixed by
  ensuring hook has sane A4 value.
 
Changes for 47.12 (09.09.2020)

- Fixed same hook issue as 47.11 occurring when "Select picture ..."
  was pressed.

Changes for 47.13 (10.09.2020)

- Changed PRESET_NAME from "WBPattern.pre" to "WBPattern.prefs".

Changes for 47.14 (10.09.2020)

- PRESET_NAME is now not set to be consistent with other Prefs editors.

Changes for 47.15 (17.09.2020)

- Revert old "feature" of being able to save patterns with more than 8 pens
  Trouble was that those pens could change color on the fly so feature would never work
  On top it dopus would crash trying to read such a settings file

Changes for 47.16 (24.3.2021)

- Fix for bug #2003. No longer crashes if gadtools.library cannot be opened.

Changes for 47.17 (4.4.2021)

- 5 new preset patterns replacing 5 old
