-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

Changes for clock 45.1 (10.2.2018)

- Recompiled with SAS/C. No functional changes.

-------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project -----------------------------

Changes for clock 47.1 (30.6.2019):

- Added an iconification gadget.

- The date of the analog clock is now rendered in the
  screen default font, making the clock font sensitive
  as well. Note that the alarm settings have already
  been font sensitive all the time.

Changes for clock 47.2 (30.6.2019):

- Minor adjustments in the font placement and size
  computation.

Changes for clock 47.3 (12.9.2019):

- Set Alarm subwindow is now being activated when opened.

Changes for clock 47.4 (3.10.2019):

- The window width is now correctly computed from the
  system boopsi extends.

Changes for clock 47.5 (15.10.2019):

- The clock did not attempt to use the localized versions
  of the date and time strings to compute the minimal
  extends of the digital clock.

Changes for clock 47.6 (23.10.2019):

- The clock saved the state of the current clock position in
  the wrong slot and hence sized clock types incorrectly.
  It now also only sets the window positions of already
  visited clock types.

Changes for clock 47.7 (4.11.2019):

- Clock no longer depends on magic constants, but uses the size
  of the system gadgets to compute the minimal and typical size.

- The title bar includes now the intuition safety margin for the
  text formatting.

- Strings in the digital date format menu are now also localized.

Changes for clock 47.8 (17.11.2019):

- The height of the date string is now included in the window
  size computation.

Changes for clock 47.9 (14.12.2019):

- The icon position is now reset to default positions before using
  the icon as AppIcon on the workbench.

Changes for clock 47.10 (5.1.2020):

- Invoking the guide via help key is now being supported.

Changes for clock 47.11 (unknown date):

- Only cleanup.

Changes for clock 47.12 (23.5.2020):

- Guide support is now locale-specific.

- Added Help-menu

- introduced UtilStatus & UtilHelp structures to match commodities' 
  & prefs' frameworks

Changes for clock 47.13 (10.6.2020):

- removed blank character in ReadArgs template which caused a crash 
  when called with an unknown argument (fixes bug #1618)

Changes for clock 47.14 (21.7.2020):

- supplying an unknown argument resulted in a hit, caused by a skipped 
  pointer initialization (finally fixes bug #1618)
- fixed a function's prototype

Changes for clock 47.15 (2.12.2020):

- fixed iconification behaviour so it uses Hide/ShowWindow() meaning
  the program name will correctly appear in Workbench reset requester
  if IPrefs attempts to reset while the clock is iconified.
