------------------------ AmigaOS 4 project ---------------------------

integer.gadget 50.1 (22.6.2002)

- bumped the version number to 50.

integer.gadget 50.2 - 50.30

- internal development versions, never released.

integer.gadget 50.31 (16.7.2002)

- first release for testing, with support for some Intuition V50 
  features.

integer.gadget 50.32 (26.9.2002)

- now supports the new "realistic shading" features of Intuition for
  hicolor and truecolor screens.

integer.gadget 50.33 (4.10.2002)

- fixed a bug which could make the gadget install an invalid backfill
  hook if its parent layout used a fill pattern.

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

integer.gadget 50.34 (18.8.2019)

- Notice that v50.34 reflects only a transitional status between the 
  OS4 and 3.2 projects.
  
- fixed race condition when opening/closing.

- fixed overflow when validating number.

- now runs on 68000/68010.

integer.gadget 47.1 (1.9.2019):

- recompiled with data=far and utllib to improve
  the code generation.

integer.gadget 47.2 (2.9.2019):

- Fixed a compiler problem, __SAVEDS was used
  with DATA=FARONLY, which confused the compiler
  a lot.

integer.gadget 47.3 (8.4.2020):

- Now -/+ button bevels use BVS_BUTTON rather than BVS_STANDARD
  (so that bevels are 1×1 thickness in Thin XEN mode).

integer.gadget 47.4 (11.4.2020):

- No longer sends a notification message after handling user input if
  the current integer value has not changed. [Adapted from V50.38]

- The internal state could become inconsistent following a successful
  ActivateGadget() call; now fixed. [Backported from V50.38]

- The gadget's minimum width was too large for any specified value of
  INTEGER_MinVisible; now fixed (bug #1290). [V50.38]

- The gadget does now react reliably to every mouse click done on the
  buttons; previously it could randomly miss some clicks. [V50.39]
  
- The "auto-repeat" of the buttons does now start after a short delay,
  rather than immediately. [V50.39]

- The minimum width calculated when specifying INTEGER_MinVisible is
  now based on the widest digit in the gadget's font, rather than the
  nominal text width of the window's RastPort. [V51.1]

- Now sets GACT_ACTIVEGADGET for the embedded string gadget when it's
  activated and clears it when going inactive again. [V53.12]

- GM_DOMAIN now always takes the size of the buttons into account for
  the gadget's minimum width computation.
  
- Added GA_BackFill and INTEGER_SkipVal to the attribute list in the
  class autodoc.

- The autodoc now makes it clear that this gadget requires and builds
  upon string.gadget (and not strgclass).
