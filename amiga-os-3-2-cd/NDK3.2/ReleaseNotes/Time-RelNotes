-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

Changes for 45.1 (18.2.2018)

- Recompiled with SAS/C

- Fixed a couple of missing initializers

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

Changes for 47.1 (27.5.2019):

- Made the GUI scalable.

Changes for 47.2 (8.6.2019):

- The program uses now the default tool icon for iconification
  if it cannot find its own icon.

- In case the font is smaller than 8x8, the GUI falls back to
  topaz.8.

- Fixed a bug in the startup code that could have caused crashes.

Changes for 47.3 (16.6.2019):

- Recompiled with a new data architecture.

Changes for 47.4 (4.8.2019):

- No longer uses sprintf from the amiga.lib.

Changes for 47.5 (18.1.2020):

- Added support for the new V47+ help system. The common PrefsEd 
  code will now scan HELP:<mylocale>/sys/Prefs/<PrefsEdName>.guide 
  for an AmigaGuide document which offers a documentation of the 
  respective Preference editor. 
  If unsuccessful, it'll search for a fallback in HELP:english/sys/.

- Replaced all custom string functions with UtilityLib's
  SNPrintf()/Strncpy() et al.

- Some cleanups.

Changes for 47.6 (19.5.2020)

- Rebuilt with the small data model. And this time it's serious.

- The classface.asm and hookface.asm files need to go, and their use
  within calendargclass.c needs to be changed to use the "modern"
  function names, i.e. DSM() -> DoSuperMethodA(), DM() -> DoMethodA,
  CM() -> CoerceMethodA(). No time for that now...

Changes for 47.7 (24.3.2021)

- Fix for bug #2003. No longer crashes if gadtools.library cannot be opened.
