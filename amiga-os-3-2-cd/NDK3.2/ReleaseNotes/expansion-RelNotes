-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

Expansion 45.1 (6.5.2018):

- findlowest trashed d0 while scanning for the lowest
  board, potentially avoiding that memory is merged
  correctly. Fixed.
  
Expansion 45.2 (11.5.2018):

- ReadExpansionRom read one byte too much from the
  config vector of the Rom. Fixed.

Expansion 45.3 (1.8.2018):

- Reading or writing configuration hardware bytes
  is now slowed down a bit, as well as the iteration
  over the configuration chain. This may help on
  some very fast boards to make AutoConfig somewhat
  more reliable.

Expansion 45.4 (12.9.2018):

- Added another NOP for synchronizing the reads.

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

Expansion 45.5 (2.1.2019):

- In case a RAM expansion board was unsized and requested
  sizing by the Os, and filled the full slot, the expansion RAM
  sizing test overwrote the last byte behind the slot address.

Expansion 45.6 (29.1.2019):

- The test for the A3000 superkickstart had the reverse logic
  and only removed the superkickstart area if the area IS NOT
  write protected. Bummer!

Expansion 45.7 (10.6.2019):

- Increased the default stack size for file systems from 600
  to 1024 bytes.

Expansion 47.1 (3.8.2019):

- Bumped expansion to 47.1 to ensure that the installer is
  able to distinguish between the 3.1.4. ROM and the 3.2 ROM.
