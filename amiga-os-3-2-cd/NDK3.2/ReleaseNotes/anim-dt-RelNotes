-------------------- AmigaOS 3.5/3.9 project -------------------------

anim 44.14 (9.3.1999)

- The library init code is now written in `C'.

- The library was compiled for use with '020 CPUs.

- The autodocs now state correctly that the source must
  be a file; clipboard input was never supported, not
  even in the initial V40 release.

- The IFF-ILBM BODY unpacker now checks whether the compression
  methods used are either cmpNone or cmpByteRun1.

- The method used for counting the number of frames in an
  anim file now takes the BODY-less storage formats into
  account and properly uses the iffparse scanner rather
  than reading and seeking through the raw file.

- The technique used for "rewinding" an IFF file now does
  proper error checking.

- The object setup code now makes sure that input comes
  from a file and does a whole lot more error checking.

- The key frame no longer needs to be stored in an IFF-ILBM
  BODY chunk; IFF-ILBM DLTA chunks are now supported, too.

- The frame loader now supports anim types 0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8,
  'J' and 'l'.

- Per-frame palette changes are now supported, too.

- The delta decoding routines are now written in `C' and
  perform extensive error checking on the input data.

- The frame decoder no longer assumes that 64000 bytes are
  sufficient to decode every BODY and DLTA data chunk.
  It reallocates a larger buffer if necessary.

anim 44.15 (14.3.1999)

- The frame loader now honours the "colour map is really 8 bits
  wide" flag proposed for use in the BitMapHeader.

anim 44.16 (27.3.1999)

- Per frame colour maps are no longer reused. They get released
  and reallocated when necessary.

anim 44.17 (27.3.1999)

- Now stores both bitmap data and colour map information
  with each frame allocated and loaded.

-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

anim 45.1 (22.7.2018)

- Backported to 68K.

- If the library init failed, the code leaked memory
  and forgot to close the already open libraries. Fixed.

anim 45.2 (27.7.2018)

- Due to a mismatch in the assembler and C header files,
  the anim base was allocated incorrectly.

anim 45.3 (14.8.2018)

- Fixed a race condition in the library base lifetime
  handling.
  
anim 45.4 (17.8.2018)

- Double-buffer handling of anims was just broken, such
  that rendering on separate screens showed artefacts.
  Delta was applied to an incorrect key frame.

anim 45.5 (1.9.2018)

- In case the anim contains a DPAN chunk of version 3
  or 4, the number of frames is taken from there.

anim 45.6 (10.9.2018)

- Fixed another race condition on LibOpen.

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

anim 47.1 (01.04.2020)

- Now computes required FPS based on frame time.
  Still does not support animations with variable frame time.

anim 47.2 (11.04.2020)

- Limit max FPS for slower machines to prevent frame skipping
  classes/datatypes/animation/anim/fpslimit

- Force user defined FPS for playing the file at given speed
  classes/datatypes/animation/anim/fps
  overrides fpslimit
