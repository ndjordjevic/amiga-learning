-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

Changes for release 45.1 (17.2.2018)

- Ed no longer uses a freaky "Ok"/"Ok" requester to
  display errors, but a standard EasyRequester

- Ed prints now the full error code in case saving
  a file failed.

- The menu layout depends now on whether the parent
  window is a new look window or not, and ed adapts.
  Unfortunately, CON: opens an "old look" menu.

- The case-insensitive search function is now locale-
  aware.

- Ed uses now memory pools to avoid leakage.

- Ed uses now a custom startup code and is by that
  much shorter.

Changes for release 45.2 (20.2.2018)

- In case CON: runs in a window of a smart console handler
  which attached a menu strip, Ed now restores the menu
  strip back in shape when it returns.

- Ed also re-establishes window-iconification now when
  leaving its window.

- Ed opens now a file requester if run from the workbench.

- Ed no longer crashes if double-clicked together with a
  file that has no icon.

- Ed does no longer open a window if run from the shell,
  it rather uses the shell window itself.

Changes for release 45.3 (21.2.2018)

- Ed supported only at most 65 lines of visible text, which
  might be too few for modern screens. Increased to 256
  lines.

- Ed left a read packet in the input of the console pending,
  which potentially crashed the console because the packet
  was released before the console answered it. ViNCEd has
  a workaround for this mess, but we better fix it here...

- Ed switches now the console buffer back and forth before
  entering and after leaving, so you get your console contents
  back. Provided you have a modern console...

- Ed no longer sends the malformed CSI 1K sequence but the
  VT220 conforming one.

- In case a file requester is aborted, ed no longer erases
  its buffer.

- The maximum file name size is no longer 30 characters.

- Ed no longer tries to edit itself if opened from the
  workbench without selecting another icon. It just shows
  the file requester then.

- Ed no longer crashes if it fails to open a disk object
  when started from the workbench.

- Ed now uses the proper locale to convert strings to upper
  case, not only for searching.

- The "invert case" command (ESC fc) is now also locale-
  sensitive.

Changes for release 45.4 (24.2.2018)

- Ed checks now whether its window stream is suitable for edits,
  in particular, whether it is interactive. It no longer attempts
  to create files in the file system if the window specification
  points to one.

Changes for release 45.5 (5.3.2018)

- This fixes one of the annoyances of ed. Pressing backspace at
  the beginning of the line merges this line now with the
  previous line.
  
Changes for release 45.6 (6.3.2018)

- This fixes the second half of the above annoyance. DEL at the
  end of the line also joins the next line.

- In case ed could not open the source file, it prints now the
  proper error message and not just "invalid file name".

- In case ed prints any error message, it now first restores
  the terminal and *then* prints the message (which would be
  otherwise lost).

- In case a user attempts to edit an interactive file, Ed prints
  now an error message and aborts.

Changes for release 45.7 (10.3.2018)

- The previous release could not create new files anymore,
  fixed.

- In case the CLI ed was run from is not interactive or the
  input stream is not interactive, ed opens now its own window.
  
Changes for release 45.8 (22.3.2018)

- Apparently, Ed did not preserve protection bits correctly
  after exiting with ESC-x. The fun part about this bug is that
  ed attempted to rename the original file to :T/Backup, potentially
  failed because T did not exist on the target device, but then
  forgot that it can not take the protection bits from the backup.

Changes for release 45.9 (21.4.2018)

- Ed is now fully localized. Ensure that you re-install the
  Sys/c.catalog.

Changes for release 45.10 (22.4.2018)

- In the ed catalog, the command for search was wrongly stated
  as ESCs, though it is ESCf.

- A ESCrp command without any command to repeat over would just
  repeat the EOF forever, hence hanging the editor.

- A command with a query-input (i.e '?' as parameter) would not
  clear out the bottom of the screen.

- The RAW console opens now over the full screen.

Changes for release 45.11 (6.5.2018)

- Fixed a missing error string in ed startup.

Changes for release 45.12 (10.6.2018)

- Fixed a problem in the memory pool administration
  of Ed.

Changes for release 45.13 (14.6.2018)

- Fixed another memory allocation bug.

Changes for release 45.14 (1.9.2018)

- Ed uses now the RVI from rexxsyslib.library V45 and no longer
  the static version from amiga.lib.
  
------------------------ AmigaOS 3.2 project -------------------------

Changes for release 45.15 (21.4.2019):

- Prints errors now over pr_CES.

Changes for release 45.16 (2.9.2019):

- Ed caused a hit in case the target channel was not a CON:
  stream. This got fixed.

Changes for release 47.1 (28.11.2019)

- Bumped to v47.

Changes for release 47.2 (24.5.2020)

- Replaced the locale string lookup code with a safer version which
  does not go off the rails if asked to look up a string ID value
  which is not stored in the local CatCompBlock data lump.
