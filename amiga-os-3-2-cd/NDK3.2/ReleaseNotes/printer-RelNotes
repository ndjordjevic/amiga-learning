- Recompiled with SAS/C

Changes for 45.3 (11.9.2018):

- Small GUI change to allow for longer gadget label texts

------------------------ AmigaOS 3.2 project -------------------------

Changes for 47.1 (18.5.2019):

- Made the GUI scalable.

Changes for 47.2 (8.6.2019):

- The program uses now the default tool icon for iconification
  if it cannot find its own icon.

- In case the font is smaller than 8x8, the GUI falls back to
  topaz.8.

- Fixed a bug in the startup code that could have caused crashes.

Changes for 47.3 (16.6.2019):

- Recompiled with a new data architecture.

- Allows the user now to enter a custom output device
  for the printer.

Changes for 47.4 (17.6.2019):

- The unit gadget is now always present, and selectable
  whenever the printer is serial, or is a custom output printer.

- There is now a button to trigger a file requester to select
  a device.

Changes for 47.5 (25.6.2019):

- Forgot to CloseDevice() an succesfully opened device and therefore
  broke subsequent attempts to open the same device, thus preventing
  usage of the "Custom" printer output.
  
Changes for 47.6 (6.7.2019):

- The target device string gadget was read even if the gadget was
  disabled, which unfortunately changed the state of the target
  printer port. As a result, the printer target device could not
  be changed back from "Custom" to something else.

Changes for 47.7 (27.12.2019):

- Added a glyph for the device selector. Looks nicer.

Changes for 47.8 (19.1.2020):

- Added support for the new V47+ help system. The common PrefsEd 
  code will now scan HELP:<mylocale>/sys/Prefs/<PrefsEdName>.guide 
  for an AmigaGuide document which offers a documentation of the 
  respective Preference editor. 
  If unsuccessful, it'll search for a fallback in HELP:english/sys/.

- Replaced most custom string functions with UtilityLib's
  SNPrintf()/Strncpy() et al.

- Some cleanups.

Changes for 47.9 (19.5.2020)

- Rebuilt with the small data model. And this time it's serious.

Changes for 47.10 (17.6.2020)

-Optimized GUI for 640x200

Changes for 47.11 (23.12.2020)

- Changed Listview tags to match size and style of the other Prefs'

Changes for 47.12 (24.3.2021)

- Fix for bug #2003. No longer crashes if gadtools.library cannot be opened.
