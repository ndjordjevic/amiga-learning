-------------------- AmigaOS 3.5/3.9 project -------------------------

MultiView 44.1 (22.4.1999)

 Bumped to V44.

MultiView 44.2 (22.4.1999)

 Now checks if a bitmap is displayable before using it as
  a screen custom bitmap.

 When using the V44 picture.datatype, no longer forces display
  of an object on a custom screen but relies upon picture.datatype
  to layout the object properly to the given screen.

MultiView 44.3 (24.4.1999)

 Now performs bounds checking when copying, concatenating and
  formatting text strings.

 When storing a window size snapshot for a window, '/' and ':'
  characters in the screen name are silently replaced with
  '.' characters.

 Now shows an error message if something goes wrong with reading
  or initialization before the output window is open.

MultiView 44.4 (25.4.1999)

 Now uses a smart window backfill hook to display full screen
  picture data if the object's bitmap is not suitable for use
  as a custom bitmap.

MultiView 44.5 (25.4.1999)

 New REPEAT and IMMEDIATE options.

MultiView 44.6 (2.5.1999)

 Lost some more of the stub code. This also avoids triggering
  an Enforcer hit when opening a new object.

MultiView 44.7 (9.6.1999)

 When opening a custom screen, MultiView now makes sure that
  all its pens are locked before the colour palette is loaded.
  This is both a) The Right Thing (tm) and b) fixes
  programs like MagicMenu which expect other programs to do
  The Right Thing. I also threw in some more code to
  make the palette loading more efficient. The old code would
  load the palette pen by pen, which would be painfully slow on
  AA machines. The new code attempts to build a table suitable
  for use with LoadRGB32() and falls back to the SetRGB32()
  method if there is not enough memory available.

MultiView 44.8 (12.6.1999)

 No longer peeks Screen->BitMap, but uses GetBitMapAttr() to
  get the information it needs.

MultiView 44.9 (6.8.1999)

 To close the MultiView window, hit ^\ or hit the [Esc]
  key twice.

MultiView 44.10 (13.8.1999)

 Added new option "PRTUNIT", which configures the printer.device
  unit used for printer dumps.

MultiView 44.11 (17.8.1999)

 Layer offset adjustments in window backfill hook code were
  unnecessary and could introduce errors with off-screen
  clipping rectangles. Fixed.

MultiView 44.12 (21.8.1999)

 No longer needs two [Esc] characters to close the window.
  Silly idea :(

MultiView 44.13 (25.8.1999)

 MultiView now gets itself a proper CLI search path list
  when launched from Workbench. This should help AmigaGuide
  when using embedded commands.

MultiView 44.14 (25.12.1999)

 When launched from Workbench, MultiView now complains showing
  an error requester if the file it is supposed to display cannot
  be loaded (such as because there is no datatype to handle it).

MultiView 44.15 (6.6.2000)

 Now closes iffparse.library upon exit (never did that before).

MultiView 45.1 (7.3.2001)

 bumped to version 45

 Added Navigation Menu entry with some search entries which is enabled
  for datatypes which support this (e.g. text.datatype 45.11).

MultiView 45.2 (7.3.2001)

 No longer jumps back to the original view position after scrolling 
  with the keyboard and then with the mouse again.

MultiView 45.3 (16.4.2001)

 Fixed problems with WBRun

MultiView 45.4 (17.9.2001)

 Mousewheel can be used to scroll vertical

MultiView 45.5 (9.11.2001)

 Added WINDOWLEFT,WINDOWTOP,WINDOWWIDTH,WINDOWHEIGHT shell args
  and tooltypes

MultiView 45.6 (17.11.2001)

 Corrected the shell template

MultiView 45.7 (18.11.2001)

 Set PDTA_DestMode to PMODE_V43

MultiView 45.8 (02.12.2001)

 WINDOWWIDTH and WINDOWHEIGHT now describes the complete dimensions
  of the window instead of the inner dimensions (without border)

MultiView 45.9 (18.01.2002)

 PDTA_DestMode is now set in NewDTObject() as it seems that it
  didn't work.

 The window dimensions weren't set for pictures

------------------------- AmigaOS 4 project --------------------------

MultiView 45.10 (28.9.2002)

 The default window position and size is now calculated correctly.

MultiView 45.11 (19.1.2003)

 Multiview threw enforcer hits when you dropped an icon on a window
  that shows the clipboard contents.

MultiView 45.12 (22.1.2004)

 ported it to ppc and  gcc.

MultiView 45.13 (16.3.2004)

 dropping an empty file on the appwindow didn't produce any error message,
  instead the old window title was still shown.

 dropping yet another file on the window while it was blocked by the file-
  requester could cause the mouse pointer to remain in busy state.

 confirming the filerequester without selecting a file was not really handled
  by the program therefore the wrong error message was shown.

MultiView 45.14 (18.8.2004)

 fixed Lock(NULL, SHARED_LOCK) when opening a new file in WINDOW mode.

 added iconification gadget. Please don't complain that you can't close
  the Workbench screen while MultiView is iconified. Will fix that later
  perhaps ;)

 added AUTORESIZE option. Setting this option causes MultiView to resize
  its window when you open a new image.

 increased minimum size of window.

 implemented support for image files containing multiple images (eg. TIFF).
  The support is very primitive, the window title shows you the number of images
  available and the '<', '>' key allow you to browse through the images. I guess
  it would be a much better idea adding the necessary trigger methods in
  picture.datatype...

-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

MultiView 45.15 (4.3.2018)

- Removed all the Os4-isms and recompiled with SAS/C.

- Ensured const-correctness of the code and moved as much as possible
  everything into a single segment.

- Due to an error in the error processor, did not print an error if
  the minimum system requirements were not met.

MultiView 45.16 (8.3.2018)

- The file requester from the workbench was opened relative to SYS: even though
  later parts of amigaguide assumed a location relative to PROGDIR:. This
  cause a discrepancy between the real node name and the assumed node name
  and caused nodes not be found if a relative path was selected in the file
  requester.
  
MultiView 45.17 (4.5.2018)

- Fixed a bug in the locale.

MultiView 45.18 (19.6.2018)

- Fixed another bug in the locale, forgot a trailer.

MultiView 45.19 (21.6.2018)

- Multiview never released the AppWindow if the window was
  never destroyed, which happened if it was never build.

- Multiview swaps now its stack on entry, reserving at least 8K
  of stack. This avoids crashes because the stack grows easily
  empty due to heavy dispatching of classes.

- Because the picture top was not rendered top-aligned at the window,
  the picture class had the idea that it would be smart to allow
  scrolling its contents. Unfortunately, the display bitmap is
  identical to the rendered result, such that the image scrolls on
  top of itself and self-destructs itself. Multiview now allocates
  the full screen for the image, setting top to 0, avoiding the
  problem.

- The hack-attack on the layer and window refresh flags has been
  removed.

MultiView 45.20 (28.6.2018)

- In case Multiview could not open the printer.device, it failed to
  indicate that it closed the printer IORequest and, as a side result,
  failed to close, and could have even released memory twice.

- Multiview tried to access PROGDIR: even if made resident and started
  as resident. In such a case, PROGDIR: does not exist and cannot be
  resolved.

MultiView 45.21 (29.6.2018)

- Increased the stack size of multiview to 10k such that the picture.datatype
  does not require stack swapping, requesting a minimum of 8K itself.

Multiview 45.22 (1.9.2019)

- Multiview uses now the RVI from rexxsyslib.library V45 and no longer
  the static version from amiga.lib.

--------------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project ----------------------

Multiview 47.1 (16.2.2019)

- Multiview now makes use of the intuition iconification mechanism and
  add an iconify icon to its window border.

Multiview 47.2 (21.2.2019)

- Only the file part of the viewed file is now used as icon name.

- Multiview uses now the new WA_IconifyGadget tag to get an iconification
  gadget. That is much simpler than building the gadget itself.

Multiview 47.3 (11.7.2019)

- If the file requester was opened before the main window, the main
  window did not get an AppWindow.

Multiview 47.4 (18.8.2019)

- Multiview uses now topaz.8 if rendered on its own screen and the
  screen width is too small.

Multiview 47.5 (14.12.2019)

- Multiview resets now the icon position to default before using it as
  AppIcon.

Multiview 47.6 (25.04.2020)

- Minimum window size reworked to prevent window gadgets overlap

- Minimum custom screen size locked to 160x100, previously could open
  tiny screens with blocked menu access and corrupt graphics

MultiView 47.7 (24.5.2020)

- Replaced the locale string lookup code with a safer version which
  does not go off the rails if asked to look up a string ID value
  which is not stored in the local CatCompBlock data lump.

MultiView 47.8 (14.7.2020)

- The pen array for a separate screen was being initialized incorrectly
  due to the increased value of NUMDRIPENS; now fixed.

- Added a new PASTE ARexx command, as a shortcut to open the contents
  of a clipboard unit (it is equivalent to OPEN CLIPBOARD CLIPUNIT).
  Also added a new "Edit/Paste" menu item which opens the contents of
  clipboard unit 0 (thus complementing "Edit/Copy").

- When requested to open an empty clipboard unit, the error message is
  now "Clipboard empty", rather than "Couldn't open".

- The "About" window does now report the width, height and depth of the
  currently displayed picture or animation.

- Names of ARexx scripts for user menus can now be up to 40 characters
  long, and they are allowed to contain spaces.

- Pressing the [Shift] key while the "Save as..." menu item is selected
  forces MultiView to save the displayed document in IFF format, rather
  than writing it in the same format as the file it was loaded from (if
  the datatype for that format supports saving).

MultiView 47.9 (16.7.2020)

- Now uses ASLFR_InitialPattern rather than ASLFR_RejectIcons to
  suppress listing icons in its ASL requester (so the user can enable
  listing them if desired).

MultiView 47.10 (20.10.2020)

- Multiview didn't open screen in full width and height, but only minimally required
  This resulted in not enough screen estate for menus.

MultiView 47.11 (27.10.2020)

- In case a picture datatype object returned a native bitmap, it would
  end up being used as custom bitmap even for a RTG screen, leading to
  all sorts of funny side effects. Now fixed.

MultiView 47.12	 (1.11.2020)

- Revert change (47.4 (18.8.2019))to use topaz on small screens

MultiView 47.13	 (11.11.2020)

- The fix in 47.10 about open full screen width and height is now applied to
  animations too
- It now sends STM_PAUSE when pressing spacebar for datatypes that understand this
- Fix pen assignments in 2 color mode costum screen (ASL looked really messed up)

MultiView 47.14 (18.1.2021)

- Now supports IDCMP_EXTENDEDMOUSE events for wheel scrolling. The same
  qualifiers available for cursor keys apply to these events as well.
  Legacy NewMouse IDCMP_RAWKEY events are still handled, in case an old
  (< V47) intuition.library is in use.
