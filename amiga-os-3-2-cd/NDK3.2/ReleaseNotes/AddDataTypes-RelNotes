-------------------- AmigaOS 3.5/3.9 project -------------------------

adddatatypes 44.1 (11.4.1999)

- AddDataTypes always lost memory when replacing an existing
  DataType. Fixed.

- Malformed DataTypes descriptor data could cause the program
  to crash whilst processing the header data. Fixed.

- Replaced the "roll your own" routine that would do a
  case-insensitive search for a node on a list.

adddatatypes 44.2 (10.5.1999)

- Changed all __aligned attributes to a different method of
  guaranteeing long word alignment.

adddatatypes 44.3 (1.7.1999)

- Added a new option: LIST/S. This will list all DataTypes
  descriptors currently in memory by descriptor name
  (e.g. "photocd" which stands for "photocd.library")
  and title (e.g. "Photo CD").

adddatatypes 44.4 (4.8.1999)

- The "built-in" datatypes binary, ascii, iff and
  directory are now initialized with a proper match
  pattern. That pattern pointer used to be NULL, and
  could cause Enforcer hits to be thrown if "real"
  datatypes descriptor files were created for the
  built-in classes.

-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

adddatatypes 45.1 (4.11.2017)

- made AddDataTypes compile again, cleaned it up.

adddatatypes 45.2 (1.9.2018)

- the initial datatypes where not initialized
  correctly, hence causing a crash when overloading
  them.

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

adddatatypes 47.1 (31.8.2019)

- when intializing data types, a pattern pointer was
  set to point to the private segment of AddDataTypes
  itself, which makes no sense whatsoever. It is now
  set to NULL, with an additional check later on that
  tolerates NULL pointers.

adddatatypes 47.2 (20.2.2020)

- Now builds without "adddatatypes_iprotos.h" and uses the
  automatically-generated prototype header file.

- Added an unused but nevertheless annoying reference to
  the "localestr/c.h" header file. Note that the
  AddDataTypes command does not need locale.library to
  work correctly and any files which seem to depend upon
  the catalog information are unused. The "texttable.h"
  file would pull in the wrong strings anyway, since these
  refer to the "Mount" command, and not to the
  "AddDataTypes" command.
