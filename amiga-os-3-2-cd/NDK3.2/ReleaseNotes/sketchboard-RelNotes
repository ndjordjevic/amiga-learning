sketchboard.gadget 50.2 (18.8.2019)

- Notice that v50.2 reflects only a transitional status between the 
  OS4 and 3.2 projects.

- fixed race condition when opening/closing.

- now runs on 68000/68010.

sketchboard.gadget 47.1 (1.9.2019):

- recompiled with data=far and utllib to improve
  the code generation.

sketchboard.gadget 47.2 (13.11.2019):

- fixed corrupt graphics in magnified mode.

sketchboard.gadget 47.3 (26.2.2020):

- Implement hotspot tool and fix hotspot drawing

sketchboard.gadget 47.4 (1.3.2020):

- Fix hotspot getter and setter methods

sketchboard.gadget 47.5 (8.3.2020):

- Fix hotspot drawing

sketchboard.gadget 47.6 (1.apr.2020):

- Create a Select too that can select a rectangle on the screen - not 
  very useful without the next tool

- Create a Move tool that can move the graphics in the selection to a 
  new place if no selection it just moves the entire image

sketchboard.gadget 47.7 (5.apr.2020):

- Small improvements to dragging the selection around

- Implement API so cut and paste of selections are possible

sketchboard.gadget 47.8 (11.apr.2020):

- Selections are now done with transparency mask

sketchboard.gadget 47.9 (29.apr.2020):

- Don't draw or move hotspot outside the gadget

- Fix memory loss

sketchboard.gadget 47.10 (9.may.2020):

- Introduce a SGA_WithBevel attribute to control if gadget is 
  with/without a bevel (default true)

sketchboard.gadget 47.11 (16.may.2020):

- Fix a rendering glitch

- Render the hotspot nice and centered (at all but scale 1 and 2)

sketchboard.gadget 47.12 (11.8.2020):

- Fixed wrong offset when pasting.

sketchboard.gadget 47.13 (29.10.2020):

- Fix wrong offset when any mouseclicking in offset(scrolled) image
- Add support for scrollwheel scrolling and zoom (hold ctrl down)
    It is also possible to choose that plain scrollwheel zooms
- Add support for domain method so it can be resized bigger
   unfortunately the minimum value can not be changed as it will
   result in small default size when embedded in a layout
- When zooming in and out do it with focalpoint in the center of the view

sketchboard.gadget 47.14 (05.11.2020):

- Don't call supermethod in OM_UPDATE as it will set the GA_ID

sketchboard.gadget 47.15 (11.mar.2021):

- Implement multi level undo redo
- Make sure we repaint when a new bitmap is set
- Introduce SGA_UpdatedBitMap so you can update bitmap without clearing undo
- Fix that scrollwheel scroll could go up to 17 times zoom which caused all
  sorts of crosstalk
- Fix render glitch if the gadget is hidden
- Fix that floodfill didn't send out changed update because it terminated
  before SELECTUP
