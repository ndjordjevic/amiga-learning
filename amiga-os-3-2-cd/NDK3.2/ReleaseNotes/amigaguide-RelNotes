-------------------- AmigaOS 3.5/3.9 project -------------------------

amigaguide 44.1 (14.3.1999)

- The window now has a proper backfill hook.

- Fixed a bug in the library init code.

- The routine that tries to find a named node in a list by
  means of a case-insensitive comparison now uses
  utility.library/Stricmp rather than a `roll your own'
  comparison routine.

- The code that saves and loads the window positions
  (as used by the "Snapshot" menu item) now makes sure that
  no directory separator characters end up in the name of
  the file to be saved. Originally, it would store the
  snapshot files by the names of the screens they would
  belong to. This would be a problem with screen names
  like "foo: bar baz" which wouldn't save correctly.

- Updated the header files.

amigaguide 44.2 (14.3.1999)

- Activated the ExpungeXRef ARexx command.

- Cleaned out all dead and unused code.

- Now requires amigaguide.datatype V44 and
  Kickstart 3.1.

- The cross reference data base data structures are now
  shared with amigaguide.datatype. This means for example
  that the linear database search is gone now, greatly
  increasing the database search speed.

- Activated the AddXRef ARexx command.

amigaguide 44.3 (15.3.1999)

- Moved over all cross reference database access routines to
  amigaguide.datatype. The database now uses "black box" access
  methods, at least as far as amigaguide.library is concerned.

amigaguide 44.4 (13.4.1999)

- OpenAmigaGuideA() and its kin would always assume that it
  would open its window on a public screen. This would go
  wrong if the provided screen was not public at all. It
  now defaults to treat the nag_Screen member of the
  NewAmigaGuide structure as a custom screen and switches
  to use public screens only if it has to.
  
-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

amigaguide 45.1 (1.9.2018)

- Amigaguide uses now the RVI from rexxsyslib.library V45 and no longer
  the static version from amiga.lib.

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

amigaguide 45.2 (4.8.2019)

- No longer uses CheckRexxMsg from amiga.lib which is clumsy.

amigaguide 45.3 (4.6.2020)

- Added some more sanity checks

- Changed GNUMakefile version to 45 to keep make version happy.

amigaguide 45.4 (18.1.2021)

- Now supports IDCMP_EXTENDEDMOUSE events for wheel scrolling. The same
  qualifiers available for cursor keys apply to these events as well.
  Legacy NewMouse IDCMP_RAWKEY events are now also handled, in case an
  old (< V47) intuition.library is in use.

amigaguide 45.5 (31.1.2021)

- No longer uses hard-coded values for the title bar height and for the
  border sizes when computing the window's default width and height.
