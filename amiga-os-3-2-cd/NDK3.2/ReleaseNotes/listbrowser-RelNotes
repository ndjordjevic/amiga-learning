  hook if its parent layout used a fill pattern.

listbrowser.gadget 50.5 (17.01.2003)

  didn't receive a DrawInfo pointer.

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

listbrowser.gadget 50.6 (18.8.2019):

- Notice that v50.6 reflects only a transitional status between the 
  OS4 and 3.2 projects.

- fixed race condition when opening/closing.

- now runs on 68000/68010.

listbrowser.gadget 47.1 (1.9.2019):

- recompiled with data=far and utllib to improve
  the code generation.
  
listbrowser.gadget 47.2 (2.9.2019):

- Fixed a compiler problem, __SAVEDS was used
  with DATA=FARONLY, which confused the compiler
  a lot.

listbrowser.gadget 47.3 (8.9.2019):

- shortened the code by adding initialization
  code for the BSS segment.

listbrowser.gadget 47.4 (8.4.2020):

- LISTBROWSER_MinVisible now takes the height of bevels and
  column titles into account.

listbrowser.gadget 47.5 (25.5.2020):

- Added CIF_CENTER and CIF_RIGHT for justifying column titles.

listbrowser.gadget 47.6 (26.5.2020):

- Now column titles are filled (with FILLPEN).

listbrowser.gadget 47.7 (30.5.2020):

- Fixed rendering bugs with rightmost column titles of autofit
  listbrowsers.

listbrowser.gadget 47.8 (12.6.2020):

- Row contents are now vertically centred.

- CIF_NOSEPARATORS is no longer ignored.

- Fixed: When LISTBROWSER_VertSeparators, FALSE was used,
  columns were too wide and didn't align with the column titles.

- LISTBROWSER_AutoFit columns with images are no longer too wide.

- Setting LISTBROWSER_Labels, NULL now also updates the
  scrollbar(s) accordingly.

- Column title separators are now draggable.

- Adjusted positioning of drag indicator.

- Fixed: too many characters were displayed in the titles of
  narrow columns.

- Fixed a hanging parenthesis in listbrowser.c which was causing
  needless refreshes.

listbrowser.gadget 47.9 (14.6.2020):

- Now clicks on read-only nodes and empty parts of the list do
  nothing.

listbrowser.gadget 47.10 (16.6.2020):

- Fixed: setting LISTBROWSER_ColumnInfo was not causing column
  widths to be recalculated.

- Fixed: GetLBColumnInfoAttrs was returning the wrong value for
  LBCIA_Weight.

- Removed unused lbd_CacheResize variable.

- Fixed: rightmost column title was not always rendered.

- Fixed: LISTBROWSER_MakeVisible had no effect if set in the
  same SetGadgetAttrs() call as LISTBROWSER_Labels.

listbrowser.gadget 47.11 (8.8.2020):

- Backported LBNCA_FillPen tag from OS4.

listbrowser.gadget 47.12 (15.9.2020):

- Support scrollwheel events

- Fixed: column titles were not being shown on <= 8-bit screens.

- Fix scrollers having wrong size

listbrowser.gadget 47.13 (18.9.2020):

- Added LISTBROWSER_AutoWheel tag.

listbrowser.gadget 47.14 (7.10.2020):

- Fixed broken input handling when using LISTBROWSER_MultiSelect.

listbrowser.gadget 47.15 (12.10.2020):

- Fix scroller size if the domain method was never called (as in case
  when not placed inside layout) (bug: 1855)

listbrowser.gadget 47.16 (16.10.2020):

- Fixed bad redrawing of listbrowser in certain situations.

listbrowser.gadget 47.17 (28.10.2020):

- Weighted column widths are now calculated correctly when there
  are fixed-width columns in use.
- FreeListBrowserNode() is now safe to call with a NULL pointer.
- Fix that RelEvent was never reset, so it would report wrong values.
- Fixed: string gadgets of editable cells were wrongly sized and
  positioned in some circumstances.

listbrowser.gadget 47.18 (15.11.2020):

- The border sizes of the list bevel are now computed more accurately
  (whenever possible) via IM_FRAMEBOX/FRAMEF_MINIMAL, which allows to
  specify a DrawInfo providing better visual context information.

- On reception of a REACTION_ChangePrefs notification, the domains of
  the embedded scrollers were not recalculated before the subsequent
  layout; this failed to update the visual thickness of the scrollers
  in already displayed listbrowsers after changing the "3D Scroller"
  option in the ReAction editor. Now fixed.

listbrowser.gadget 47.19 (12.02.2021):

- Follow up from 47.15 as it turns out that sometimes (if no Reaction
  prefs) the call would have no GInfo and the scroller would end up with
  wrong size. Now we just patienly await until it is correct.

- We were sending out way too many updates. The code thought it was only
  sending out a subset, but then OM_NOTIFY just sent out everything anyway
  The committed change doesn't completely clean up the notify method,
  but at least now it works.

listbrowser.gadget 47.20 (21.02.2021):

- Change look of edit box to have a box around and correct colors
- Change how clicking to edit works, now you can still double click
  an already selected item without it going directly to edit mode

- Fix keyboard navigation
- Major of the code
- Introduce StayActive mode
- Less repaints and updates (now only as many as neeeded)

listbrowser.gadget 47.22 (3.03.2021):

- Make it so pressing escape during rename will abort witout change
- Fix that rename didn't work in tabactive mode
- Fix LISTBROWSER_NumSelected counting wrong
- Fix going into edit mode could happen wrongly at some combination
  of mouseclicks

listbrowser.gadget 47.23 (24.03.2021):

- Fix clicking in list that doesn't show selection

listbrowser.gadget 47.24 (02.04.2021):
