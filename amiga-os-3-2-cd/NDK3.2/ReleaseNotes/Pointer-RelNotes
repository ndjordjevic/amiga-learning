-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

Changes for 45.1 (18.2.2018)

- Recompiled with SAS/C

- Fixed a couple of missing initializers

Changes for 45.2 (7.8.2018)

- Due to missing calls to WaitBlit(), the
  blitter might have been still busy while
  the bitmap was already released, or was
  written out before the blit was actually done.

- Removed unnecessary stub functions.

- The code was directly peeking Screen->BitMap.Depth, which is known
  to go wrong for RTG screens. Changed this to GetBitMapAttr(), and
  limited the screen depth to 8.

- When loading ILBM graphics from the clipboard or file, the code
  also specified the target screen it is running on. While in 
  principle a good idea, this also instructed the picture.datatype to 
  potentially allocate an RTG bitmap which the code is unable to 
  handle... Yuck! Hence, the picture datatype now only gets the 
  colors, and then creates a native bitmap.

Changes for 45.3 (10.8.2018)

- The size of the sparse color table for rendering any incoming bitmap
  on Paste or Load was still computed incorrectly.

- There was still one explicit reference to Screen->BitMap.Depth which
  will not work correctly on RTG screens.

Changes for 45.4 (12.8.2018)

- The hot-spot adjustment when switching resolutions did not work 
  correctly. This got fixed.

- Fixed more invalid bitmap handling.

-------------------------------AmigaOS 3.2 project -------------------

Changes for 47.1 (31.05.2019):

- Made the GUI scalable.

Changes for 47.2 (08.06.2019):

- Rendering the example bitmap did not work properly on
  true color screens.

- Fixed the logic for triggering refreshes. Drawing into the gadget
  no longer clears the activity flag, but refreshing does.

- The program uses now the default tool icon for iconification
  if it cannot find its own icon.

- In case the font is smaller than 8x8, the GUI falls back to
  topaz.8.

- Fixed a bug in the startup code that could have caused crashes.

Changes for 47.3 (15.06.2019):

- Restructured the compiler settings, creating better code now.

Changes for 47.4 (11.07.2019):

- The custom screen open code was needlessly complicated, removed some
  of the useless code.

- The startup code now checks for a minimal font width and enlarges
  the layout grid if necessary.

Changes for 47.5 (12.07.2019):

- The magnification factor is now adjusted with the font size.

Changes for 47.6 (19.01.2020):

- Added support for the new V47+ help system. The common PrefsEd 
  code will now scan HELP:<mylocale>/sys/Prefs/<PrefsEdName>.guide 
  for an AmigaGuide document which offers a documentation of the 
  respective Preference editor. 
  If unsuccessful, it'll search for a fallback in HELP:english/sys/.

- Replaced most custom string functions with UtilityLib's
  SNPrintf()/Strncpy() et al.

- Some cleanups.

Changes for 47.7 (18.02.2020):

- Added support for 40 different standard pointertypes (same as OS4)

Changes for 47.8 (07.03.2020):

- This is a big change for pointer prefs we now use the standard 
  sketchboard.gadget

- And the gui have been moved around to better allow editing 40 
  pointer types

- As a result we now have a few more drawing tools than before

Changes for 47.9 (10.mar.2020)

- Implement screen aspect ratio awareness

- Implement preview by holding down space bar

- Change "Use default instead" to "Pointer has custom image" thus 
  negating it's meaning

Changes for 47.10 (10.apr.2020)

- UI reshuffle

- use the new select and move tools of sketchboard.gadget

- fix the glyphs of the buttons

- Cut,copy and paste now works (on selections)

Changes for 47.11 (13.apr.2020)

- Refresh the colors on of the drawing and palette when pulling 
  sliders on truecolor displays

- Don't store deselected pointer types with a number so high it 
  becomes negative in inutition

- Change the UI a bit again and make the test button work like the 
  spacebar

Changes for 47.12 (27.apr.2020)

- Should x2 scale the sketchboard in window mode if we have enough 
  screen space

- Better GUI scaling with exotic fonts

- Fix memory leak

- Fix preview resolution being unlike what is saved

- Fix use/save messing pointers up for ECS machines (they saved 4x too 
  much)

- Hide the hires gadget when on OCS/ECS that don't support it

- Order pointer types in a more logical sequence

Changes for 47.13 (11.may.2020)

- Sketchpad bevels are now always system frame

Changes for 47.14 (20.5.2020)

- Removed support for making prefs editors resident.

- Removed the "far" qualifier from all data declarations.

- Added SAS/C-specific code which clears the BSS data.

- Deleted all the old unused assembly language code.

Changes for 47.15 (06.06.2020)

- increasead gui size to help translators with long strings

Changes for 47.16 (12.06.2020)

- Improve startup time by a factor 4 - whic is really important on 
  bare 68000 machines
  
- Don't use topaz8 when on screen but rather rely on the VerifyFont to 
  do the work if needed

Changes for 47.17 (01.07.2020)

- Don't modify the gad fields after creation - it's a no no with 
  gadtools

Changes for 47.18 (05.09.2020)

- Fixed crash that occurs if a window refresh is needed when the "load 
  image" requester is open.
  
- Pointer editing area now properly displays newly loaded pointer set.

Changes for 47.19 (17.09.2020)

- Update colors when previewing the pointer.

Changes for 47.20 (17.09.2020)

- Calculate ed_Width and ed_Height right after loading the prefs to 
  avoid writing a damaged prefs file to ENV: when calling Pointer 
  Prefs with the FROM ... USE arguments from the shell
  (Fixes bug #1817)

Changes for 47.21 (29.09.2020)

- Public screen handling now works as expected:
   - The program checks if the public screen set by the ToolType already exists
   - If yes, the screen is examined if it's suitable for our needs 
     (required depth, exclusive pens available)
   - If the screen is suitable, the prefs window will be opened there
   - If the screen is not suitable, Pointer prefs will fall back to Workbench screen
   - If the Workbench screen is not suitable, the program will open it's own screen
   - If the public screen set by the ToolType is not found, Pointer prefs will 
     open a new public screen using that name.

Changes for 47.22 (12.10.2020)

- Fix "save", "use", "cancel" button placement with wide font (bug:1810)

Changes for 47.23 (04.11.2020)

- Let the window take up the entire screen when not in window mode
- Fix momentary garbage when previewing

Changes for 47.24 (25.12.2020)

- Corrected size of scroller to match other prefs default 18 pixels

Changes for 47.25 (12.03.2021)

- Use the new Multi level undo redo

Changes for 47.26 (24.3.2021)

- Fix for bug #2003. No longer crashes if gadtools.library cannot be opened.
