----------------------- AmigaOS 4 project ---------------------------- 

window.class 46.1 (22.02.02)

- initial release for OS4. Not every v45 feature is
  implemented yet.

window.class 50.1 (5.7.2002)

- bumped the version number to 50.

window.class 50.2 - 50.24

- internal development versions, never released.

window.class 50.25 (6.8.2002)

- first release for testing, with support for some Intuition V50 
  features.

window.class 50.27 (28.8.2002)

- now uses the bitmap sharing functions of Intuition V50 to handle the
  backfill patterns in a more optimized way.

  IMPORTANT NOTE: the class still works with Intuition V40, but if used
  under V50 it *requires* at least intuition.library 50.13!

window.class 50.28 (8.10.2002)

- small adjustment in backfill handling, now REQUIRES Intuition 50.16
  (if used under V50).

window.class 50.29 (13.11.2002)

- now the iconify gadget uses the automatic titlebar gadget positioning
  offered by Intuition V50.

window.class 50.30 (21.02.2003)

- re-implemented auto (de)iconification feature.

- added WA_ToolBox, WA_Hidden, WA_WindowBox, WA_MenuHook to the
  list of supported tags.

window.class 50.31 (09.03.2003)

- implemented WPOS_CENTERWINDOW (actually the same as
  WPOS_CENTERSCREEN).
  
- fixed WPOS_FULLSCREEN (didn't open the window at the
  right position and size).

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project -------------------------- 

window.class 50.32 (18.8.2019)

- Notice that v50.32 reflects only a transitional status between the 
  OS4 and 3.2 projects.
  
- fixed race condition when opening/closing.

- now runs on 68000/68010.

window.class 47.1 (1.9.2019):

- recompiled with data=far and utllib to improve
  the code generation.

window.class 47.2 (8.9.2019)

- iconification gadget and busy pointer now always use
  built-in Intuition functionality.
  
window.class 47.3 (8.9.2019)

- removed dead code

- moved all globals to the library base

window.class 47.4 (9.9.2019)

- In case the window backfill was turned off, the
  window class could crash.
  
window.class 47.5 (18.9.2019)

- The window class IDCMP handling had a race condition
  that could result in a damaged input message list and
  as a result, the window class may have looped forever.

- As part of another bug, the window input handler could
  have also forgotten to reply some intuition messages,
  thus causing memory holes.

window.class 47.6 (19.9.2019)

- Fixed: IDCMP hook result was always being acted upon,
  even when WINDOW_InterpretIDCMPHook was FALSE.
  
window.class 47.7 (28.9.2019)

- The backfill hook caused MuForce hits in case the rastport
  to render to was not equipped with a layer.

window.class 47.8 (14.12.2019)

- An incoming delivered IDCMP message was replied too
  early and might have triggered problems in the IDCMP
  hook then.

- If the window was closed as part of a user hook, then
  the code forgot to re-check the validity of the window
  pointer.

window.class 47.9 (19.12.2019)

- Also put up tooltips gadgethelptext for icons not in layout

window.class 47.10 (22.12.2019)

- Fixed window preferences refresh loop. The 47.9 could run into
  an endless refresh due to an error in the loop iteration.
  
window.class 47.11 (7.1.2020)

- In case the window position is not specified in any particular
  way, the window class does not set the tags for OpenWindowTags()
  either, such that intuition picks the position for it.

window.class 47.12 (26.1.2020)

- There was some confusion concerning how the offset calculation
  for the backfill hook works. This had the result that the pattern
  offset for smart refresh windows of the window class was mismatched
  in case the pattern was refreshed under a hidden part of the window
  if the window was resized. I.e. resizing a smart window trashed
  the obscured parts of the window.
  
window.class 47.13 (3.4.2020)

- Added a WPOS_ENTIRESCREEN option for the WINDOW_Position tag.

- Now WMHI_VANILLAKEY messages are sent on the downstroke rather than
  the upstroke of the key.

window.class 47.14 (15.6.2020)

- Changed default fallback font to match ReAction Preferences.

window.class 47.15 (15.6.2020)

- Use the new GM_QUERYHOVERED method to implement tooltips. The main
  benefit is that we no longer have potentially dangling pointers to
  gadgets and strings.

window.class 47.16 (7.7.2020)

- Added WINDOW_Qualifier tag from OS4.

window.class 47.17 (13.7.2020)

- Align half-light and half-dark colors with MagicWB

window.class 47.18 (08.9.2020)

- Implement old style tooltips - seems to have never worked in 3.2 
  reaction

window.class 47.19 (21.11.2020)

- Changed the way the Workbench setup/cleanup hook is installed and
  removed, to prevent AmiDock from blocking resets of the Workbench
  screen (bug #941).


window.class 47.20 (03.12.2020)

- Fix that tooltips could flicker under some circumstances
- Fix that tooltips  would pop up again too soon
- Fix that tooltips didn't show when a gadget was active
