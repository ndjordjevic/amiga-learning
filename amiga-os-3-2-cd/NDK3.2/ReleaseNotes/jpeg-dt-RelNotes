------------------------ AmigaOS 3.5/9 project -----------------------

jpeg.datatype 44.1 (13.4.99)

- Bumped to V44.

jpeg.datatype 44.2 (9.8.99)

- For greyscale output, no longer sets the picture's colour palette.
  This is done implicitly by picture.datatype now.

jpeg.datatype 44.3 (4.9.99)

- Replaced the descriptor file. The old one was limiting the files
  recognized by this datatype to JFIF-format files only. The IJG
  library can read more than just this format. The new descriptor
  takes care of this now.

jpeg.datatype 44.4 (26.9.2000)

- Rewrote the data type recognition function which is part of the
  descriptor file. It now resembles the scanner the JPEG code uses,
  which allows it to identify JPEG format files which the old
  recognition function could not. This includes formats such as the
  thumbnail files created by digital cameras.

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

jpeg.datatype 47.1 (19.5.2020)

- dusted off the 3.5/3.9 JPEG datatype 

- replaced JPEG-6b by JPEG-9d (old 6b still kept in svn for now)

- implemented YCCK-RGB and CMYK-RGB conversion functions in JPEG-9d (jdcolor.c)

jpeg.datatype 47.2 (21.5.2020)

- finished testing JPEG 6b, 9d and libjpeg-turbo codebases as prospective
  starting points for new JPEG datatype codebase: chose libjpeg-turbo
  as most flexible and fastest among those three

- trimmed unused functionality in libjpeg-turbo for smaller binary size

- ported latest iDCT from JFIFdt44 (accurate and fast)

- optimized ASM version of iDCT is automatically enabled on 68020+

- implemented direct write into picture.datatype where available (V47)

jpeg.datatype 47.3 (21.5.2020)

- implemented fast color transform from YCbCr to RGB

jpeg.datatype 47.4 (22.5.2020)

- reworked greyscale JPEG support to stick to the 8 bit 
  representation to picture.datatype in order to save memory

jpeg.datatype 47.5 (4.6.2020)

- fixed a (harmless) MuGa hit caused by a bug in the memory
  alignment code of libjpeg-turbo

jpeg.datatype 47.5 (9.6.2020)

- no functional changes but an update to the Makefile

jpeg.datatype 47.6 (21.6.2020)

- Updated the SendPacket() function to use SendPkt(), as it should
  have done all along.
