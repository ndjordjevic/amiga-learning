-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

Changes for release 45.1 (14.8.2018)

- Fixed a race condition on library lifetime handling.

- Fixed a potential memory leak on library init.

Changes for release 45.2 (16.8.2018)

- Backported the main body of the 44.9 to 3.1.4
  to include support for 24-bit ILBMs.
  
Changes for release 45.3 (10.9.2018)

- Fixed another race condition on LibOpen.

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

Changes for release 45.4 (5.4.2020)

- Made the class initialization code a bit shorter.

- Removed class_iprotos.h since it wasn't being used.

- Added documentation to the code where it seemed to
  be helpful.

- The ByteRun1 decompression code no longer has two
  branches of which only one writes to the destination
  bit plane row. It's all done in a single function
  with no duplicate code now. I bet it's not even
  slower than before, since it now uses memset() and
  memcpy() instead of moving bytes one at a time.
  Certainly is more readable.

- If the CAMG chunk is absent from the file, or the
  mode data seems unsound, a mode is now synthesized
  by looking at the picture's dimensions.

Changes for release 47.1 (5.4.2020)

- We now try to read the mask bit plane if available
  and let picture.datatype know that it might want to
  copy it, in case it comes in handy later. Note that
  this feature requires picture.datatype V47 and may
  not even work...

- Now has a proper name: "ilbm.datatype" rather than
  just "ilbm".

Changes for release 47.2 (20.6.2020)

- Added preparations for avoidance of ChipRAM usage
  in case of active RTG systems.

Changes for release 47.3 (21.6.2020)

- This version supports 1-8 bitplanes including EHB
  (but not HAM) in FastRAM loading mode for RTG 
  systems.

- Reduced memory allocations in planar to chunky mode

Changes for release 47.4 (3.3.2021)

- The presence of a mask plane for 8 BPP images led
  to overwritten memory in V42 planar mode. Also,
  the contents of the mask plane were effectively
  ignored in V42 mode.
