------------------------ AmigaOS 4 project ---------------------------

palette.gadget 46.1 (18.02.02)

- initial release for OS4.

palette.gadget 50.1 (25.4.2002)

- bumped the version number to 50.

- now the gadget sends interim OM_UPDATE messages only if its 
  GA_Immediate attribute is TRUE.

- gadget operations are now aborted as soon as the right mouse button
  is clicked, rather than when it is released.

- the layout of color boxes does now use an enhanced version of the 
  code from the palette gadget of gadtools.library, thus ensuring a 
  consistent appearance between the two gadgets. Also, it looks better.

- now the gadget supports custom rendering hooks for palette boxes.

- some code optimizations.

palette.gadget 50.2 - 50.4

- internal development versions, never released.

palette.gadget 50.5 (26.8.2002)

- fixed a bug which caused the window backfill pattern to show around
  the selected color box after a GM_RENDER.

palette.gadget 50.6 (24.9.2002)

- improved support for the "flat" Intuition frame style.

palette.gadget 50.7 (26.11.2002)

- now the palette background is filled with BACKGROUNDPEN rather than
  with color zero.

- further improved "flat" style support.

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

palette.gadget 50.8 (18.8.2019)

- Notice that v50.8 reflects only a transitional status between the 
  OS4 and 3.2 projects.
  
- fixed race condition when opening/closing.

- now runs on 68000/68010.

palette.gadget 47.1 (1.9.2019):

- recompiled with data=far and utllib to improve
  the code generation.
  
palette.gadget 47.2 (2.9.2019):

- Fixed a compiler problem, __SAVEDS was used
  with DATA=FARONLY, which confused the compiler
  a lot.
