-------------------- AmigaOS 3.1.4.(1) project -----------------------

Changes for bootmenu 45.1 (commit log unavailable)

- there are no longer separate builds for the A600 and the CDGS
  all models do now get a diagnostic screen.
  
- Similar to the 3.9 version, the AA models do now get a DblPAL
  and DblNTSC monitor in the VGAonly variant.

- The monitor setup has been streamlined, a lot of duplicate code
  has been removed.

- syscheck has been factored out, but still requires the bootmenu
  main code.

- Previous releases offered also scan-doubled modes, even if the
  chipset did not support them.
  
Changes for bootmenu 45.2 (commit log unavailable)

- One can now cycle through all available display modes with the
  space bar (or any other key, for that matter).

- DblModes are now only available if there is also a HIRES Denise
  or something better. Note that a HIRES Agnus is not good enough
  by itself to get Dbl modes on ECS machines.

- Reduced the stack footprint somewhat.

- The bootstrap code now only sets the default monitor if the
  monitor in question can be made available to the system.

- Removed a lot of code duplications.

Changes for bootmenu 45.4 (commit log unavailable)

- Fixed keyboard handling, pressing a qualifier key now no longer
  reboots the machine.
  
- Removed more code duplications in the monitor setup.

- Fixed rendered text indicating keyboard shortcuts, this is now
  machine dependent.

- As ECS cannot display a 640x200/640x256 screen in 31kHz, removed
  the Dbl modes now for ECS.

Changes for bootmenu 45.5 (19.4.2018)

- Cursor keys no longer trigger a screen mode change.

- Along with the corresponding Dbl monitor, the base monitor is
  also added to the system to ensure that the fallback to the
  video mode indicated in GfxBase works.

Changes for bootmenu 45.6 (5.8.2018)

- Note that the following changes actually affect syscheck, not
  bootmenu, but the syscheck module does not have its own code
  and simply jumps into parts of the bootmenu code.

- Boards that have been shut up by the autoconfig process are
  no longer listed as "defective", only as "disabled".

- In case one or multiple boards have been shut-up (i.e. disabled
  from autoconfig due to lack of autoconfig area), the bootmenu
  will now appear, too. It will just list the disabled boards,
  but does not show a red background. Instead, it will be in
  the usual grey.

----------------------- AmigaOS 3.2 project --------------------------

Changes for bootmenu 47.1 (27.6.2019):

- The bootmenu will now open intuition only if needed for the
  graphical user interface, and will otherwise leave it alone.
  This enables later replacement. It also means that enlightenment
  of intuition may have to be delayed up to system-startup.

Changes for bootmenu 47.2 (4.8.2019):

- No longer uses sprintf of amiga.lib.

Changes for bootmenu 47.3 (7.8.2019):

- The input.devices requires a little wakeup call to be able
  to read the qualifier. This was formerly called by the
  console.device, but the boot order changed.

Changes for bootmenu 47.4 (27.9.2019):

- Added additional boot flags, and a new boot-key-combo (either
  ALT key) to enable debugging of the boot shell.

Changes for bootmenu 47.5 (20.10.2019):

- Added a GUI and options to enable the system log.

Changes for bootmenu 47.6 (27.3.2020):

- Added board address and size columns to Expansion Board Diagnostic 
  page

- Rewrote the code that draws the Expansion Board Diagnostic table

Changes for bootmenu 47.7 (28.3.2020):

- Added board type column

- Copied board size estimation from ShowConfig code

- Compacted table rendering code to reduce additional ROM space impact

Changes for bootmenu 47.8 (7.9.2020):

- Added Failsafe boot flag

- Boot page: aligned checkboxes with Active Devices listview gadget

Changes for bootmenu 47.9 (15.10.2020):

- Improved keyboard navigation: made sub-pages accessible by keyboard
  shortcuts (including boot device selection by "cursorUP", "cursorDOWN")

Changes for bootmenu 47.10 (31.12.2020):

- Added some more shortcuts (display sub-page), improved listview behaviour
  in boot device selection, also shortcuts for toggles
- Kickstart release version shown on main page

Changes for bootmenu 47.11 (01.01.2021):

- eliminated (harmless) compiler warnings from bootmenu.c
- more keyboard shortcuts and some fine tuning: ESC no longer degrades 
  available modes to non ECS on main menu (see "original" on GFX page), 
  only SPACE to toggle PAL/NTSC or DBLPAL/DBLNTSC
- added display of soft-kicked exec version on main page, if present
