The "arp", "ping" and "traceroute" commands which stem from the same
4.4BSD-Lite2 Unix were among the first I ported when Roadshow began
to take shape.

All these programs have been adapted to the Amiga, which at times involved
rather complex changes, such as the time interval calculations performed
by "ping" and "traceroute", respectively.

The changes I made are placed in the public domain. The original source
code license still applies, though.
